# Background
## A sense of scale
### Stommel diagrams
Plot a log of time(s) against a log of space(m).
### Reductionism
Describing or analysing complex phenomenon in terms of phenomena held to represent a simpler or more fundamental level, which if fully understood can provide a complete explanation/prediction for the complex phenomenon
### Holism
The theory/position that the hole can be more than simply the some of the parts due to the interactions between the parts which lead to emergent properties. (emergent properties can only be observed at the right scale)
### Scales in ecology
#### Ecosystem ecology
Biosphere
Biome
High level ecosystems
Ecosystem
#### Community ecology
Community
Population
#### Organismal ecology
Organism
tissue
Cell
### Malthusians 
Organisms don't grow independently they are constrained by energy and material requirements which leads to regulatory  feedback associated with thomas malthusian.
### Classical economics
There are not limits to growth because human ingenuity will always outpace human expansion.
Associated with Ester boserup

### Applications
Determining carrying capacity
How much can be harvested from stock without upsetting cultivation environment
Existential crisis, limits to growth.

## Systems
### Not systems
Single object with inputs and outputs
Multiple objects which interact linear with each other, (ie no circular causality)
The interactions of one object with another could just be thought of as a input to the object in question and it could be analysed in isolation.
### (chaotic) systems
2 or more objects which interact with each other, this implies circular causality and non linear models must be used, and bifurcations often result
#### Complex systems
Complex system are not necessarily complicated in the conventional sense of the word, but they are very hard to predict.
Characteristics
##### Multiple stable states
##### It is very hard to predict how to shift between stable states, or what parameters variables must remain within to sustain a given stable state.(threshold/sepratrics)
##### Multiple factor causes
##### Circular causality
##### Emergent properties

## Definitions
### Emergent properties
Properties which can only be observed at the correct scale as the result from interactions between parts which are not apparent when viewing those parts in isolation
For example climate is a emergent property of weather, Clouds are an emergent property of water vapour particles in the atmosphere
### Bifurcations
Small random changes in a system which can lead to large changes in the direction or ultimate stable state which the system settles at.

## Argument forms
### Dialectic argument
Thesis + antithesis (becomes) synthesis
## Exams
### Questions list
Draw sommel diagram place an ecosystem.
Define ecosystem and emergent properties.
### Exams
In exams questions will be very broad requiring one to pick a stance and make a convincing case for it.
### Test 
Tests will have shorter more direct questions
