\subparagraph{response to a given
factor.}\label{response-to-a-given-factor.}}

In general the response on and organism to increasing
amounts/concnetrations of any given factor shows humped shape growth
curve. this growth curve can be split into several sections.

sub critical

bellow the minimum level of the factor which the organism needs to
survive.

sub optimal

the organism can survive but is not yet operating optimally due to a
shortage of the factor.

optimal

the organism has exactly the most beneficial amount of the factor and
all other things being equal, is growing at the highest possible rate.

supra optimal

the organism is growing at below optimal rate because it has a
detrimental excess of the factor.

NOTE: Animals like salt so much, because plants (which don't really need
it) don't store in it in large quantities, therefore animals must find
mineral sources of salt to augment their plant diets.

water availability

97\% of water is salt water of the remaining 3\%, 70\% is frozen, 29\%
is underground and 1\% remains in rivers and lakes.

Plants (from saturated to dry) 1. Aquatic 2. Emergent macrophytes 3.
Mesophytes 4. Xerophytes

Animals 1. Aquatic 2. Amphibious 3. Land-dwelling Water-dependent. 4.
water independent.

\hypertarget{liebigs-law-of-the-minimum}{%

growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources but by the
amount of the scarcest resource necessary for growth.

\hypertarget{example-redfield-ration}{%
\subparagraph{example: redfield ration}\label{example-redfield-ration}}

biological entities/system show a very precise and constant element
ratio or C:N:P:

100:10:1 in Soil
100:5:1 in Leaves
19:3:1 Vertebrates

An increase in any element above that ratio will lead to no additional
growth.

environment. Earth lies in the goldilocks zone with regard to
temperature, (and a number of) other conditions, not because of its
location but more because it has an atmosphere which is capable of
maintaining it at a stable temperature suitable suitable for life. the
peculiar conditions found on earth result in part from the way the
biosphere has acted to shape the climate, mineral distribution etc.
