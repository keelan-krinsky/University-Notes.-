### Phenylketonuria
single mutation
can affect brain development however if the correct diet is followed then all detrimental health consequences can be ignored.

### diabetes type II
lifestyle disease, the genetic component is estimated to change the likelihood of developing the disease by 2%, but the main causative factors of the disease relate to diet.

### Lactose intolerance.
Individuals with lactose intolerance cant digest lactose, however the bacteria in their gut van which leads to the build up of gas. this can be very painful for the person in question.In humans lactose intolerance would naturally occur after weening however as cow milk is a staple part of most human diabetes the genes controlling lactase production are never switched off and the ability to digest lactose is not normally lost.

### Himalayan Phenotype.

### Cancer

#### basics
A cancer is a group of cells whose proliferation is uncontrolled, and which can spread to other locations in the body which are normally populated bu other cell types.

##### benigin tumours
grow but do not spread.

##### malignant tumours
over proliferate and invade other body tissues/ areas in the body.  

#### types of cancers

##### Carcinomas
 derived form epithelial cells

##### Sarcomas
 derived from connective or muscle tissues. Known as Osteosarcoma in the case of bone tissue and Kaposi sarcoma in the case of soft connective tissue.  

##### Lymphoma and leukaemias
1. Cancers of the hematopoietic system.
2. Lymphoma (solid tumour)
3. Leukaemia excess of circulating immature blood cell precursors.
##### Cancer of the nervous system
brain and central nervous system.

NOTE: most common in children

##### Germ-line cancer.

##### Cancers of breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, and colon.

### Causes of cancer.
In most cases cancer is not inherited. In  breast cancer/ovarian cancer BS1, BS2 play some role in genetic disposition, perhaps 5-10%

### hereditary.
Cancer normally sets in during old age as cells must accumulate a series of a specific set of notations, (exactly which set of mutations accumulated lead to cancer is highly individual)

#### Environmental factors
1. UV
2. X rays
3. Alcohol
4. Overcooked food (hetercyclic amines,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-meat. acrylamide- potatoes
5. Azo dyes
6. tartrazine (food colourants)
7. Nitrate cured foods
8. Pesticides

#### Cancer initiators
agents which cause DNA damage (mutagens). these factors may be chemical, biological (such as HPV- human papilloma virus cause latent genetic damage- Cancer predisposition.

#### Cancer Promoters

Promotes excessive proliferation (does not directly damage DNA).

##### Examples
1. wounding
2. phorbol esters
3. HRT/ oestrogen (breast cancer)
4. hepatitis B (promotes stomach cancer)
5. HIV (Kaposi sarcoma, this disease is always present but only manifests itself in immunocompromised individuals)

#### stages of cancer development  
1. normal cells (mutation occcurs)
2. increased ability to proliferate (mutation)
3. 1-2mm tumour of rapidly proliferating cells which do not undergo apoptosis of differentiation. (mutation)
4. vascularized growing tumour (mutation)
5. large tumour capable of invading near by tissue (metastasis)

NOTE: cancer results from a series of somatic mutations, affecting the same cell, and different cancers are genetically heterogeneous.

#### Genetic instability in cancers.
deficient local DNA repair leads to the accumulation of point mutations increased chromosomal instability and gross genome abnormalities.

#### summary of key properties
1. disregards ex/in growth regulation signals.
2. avoid apoptosis, differentiation and replicative senescence
3. genetically unstable.
4. invasive
5. metastatic (survive and proliferate in foreign) sites.

#### Penetrance
 percentage of the population who demonstrate at least some degree fo phenotypic expression.

#### Expressivity
reflects the range of expressions of the gene/allele present in the population.  

#### Genetic complementation
two different mutations in heterozygous condition affecting the same protein/ pathway can compliment each other to cause a novel phenotypic effect.

##### examples
rare form of albinism: both mother and father were normally pigmented and there families had minimal instances of albinism. however both children where albino' s . Analysis found that this albinism stemmed not from those genes and mutation most commonly associated with albinism but rather from a combination of recessives (heterozygous) from both father and mother (mutations in TYRP1 gene), which on their own would have little or no effect on the pigment production pathway, but when combined reduced pigment production significantly.

NOTE: Rufus albinism leads to a phenotype with reddish hair, lighter skin, and blue grey eyes.

#### Forked line probability method.

##chromosome level
(revise mitosis and meosis)
copy slides
chromosome basic structure
#### chromosome groups

##### meta-centric
centromere is half way up the length of the chromosome

##### submetacentric
centromere is more to the one side of the chromosome than the other,

##### Acrocentric
the centromere is very far to the one side of the chromosome, with a long arm containing most of the genes and a short arm containing predominantly temolmeric DNA.

##### Telocentric  
humans do not posses any telocentric chromosomes, but certain insect of crustation species do.

##### Holocentric
Centromere like structure exist along the entire length of the chromosome. this may decrease the chances of faulty division/ segregation.

##### chromosome banding
bands were named and used to locate specific genes. the banding patterns are due to uneven DNA densities in the coiled structure of the chromosome.

##### Size and shape of different chromosomes.

### Chromosome level mutations

#### Aneuploidy (Spelling)
Each cell is has at least one extra chromosome or is missing at least one chromosome

##### Trisomy
when an individual inherits three copies of a particular chromosome.
In Humans only three of all the possible trisomies are viable, (as in individuals with these mutations will still be born and not terminated during pregnancy)

of these three (Trisomy 13, 18, and 21) only individuals with trisomy 21 can survive past the first few years of childhood. Individuals with Trisomy 21 have down syndrome.

###### Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)
Frequency: 1/1000
Effects
1. mental retardation
2. short stature
3. heart disease
4. shortened life span.

###### Edward Syndrome (Trisomy 18)
Effects:
1. kidney and intestinal malformation
3. heart defects.
4. mental retardation

NOTE: only 8% survival past the first year.

###### Patua syndrome (Trisomy 13 )
Effects:
1. Kidney and hear defects
2. polidactily (too many digits)
3. Nervous system abnormalities
4. Death within the 1st year.



NOTE: the smaller relative size of chromosome 21, meaning that it contains less important genes may be related to its increased viability .

##### Monosomy
when an individual inherits only one copy of a particular chromosome.

##### Nullisomy
having no copies of a particular chromosome.

#### Polyploidy

#### Structural rearrangements
1. deletion
2. duplication
3. translocation
4. inversion
5. fission
6. fusion

#### non disjuncture
(review mitosis and meiosis)
If non disjuncture happens in meiosis it is generally worse than if it happens in mitosis as it will affect the whole organism.

##### Down Syndrome
occurs in about 1 of a thousand live births. originates from non disjunction in the egg cell rather than the sperm cell because the arrested development of the egg cells leads to decay of the separating and marking proteins as well as the spindle fibre leaving the whole process open to more error.
8% of individuals survive for one year ?

##### turner Syndrome monosomy X
Frequency 1/20 000 (only occurs in females )
Effects:
1. webbed neck
2. short stature
3. underdeveloped ovaries and lack of secondary sex characteristics.

##### Klinefelter syndrome XXY
Too many X's ,XXY , XXXY, XXXXY, XXXXXY. (XXYY)
Effects:
1. Decrease in testosterone levels
2. the more X's the higher the chance of brain damage.

##### XYY
XYY has the phenotype of a normal make.
men with 2 Y chromosomes tend to be tall as there is a cumulative effect adding to height. (they may also exhibit increased aggression but this in unclear)

##### XXX
Frequency: 1/1000
Effects:
1. Normal female with normal fertility.

NOTE: this conditions is seldom diagnosed.


#### Polyploidy
Three or more complete sets of chromosomes present in somatic cells.
#### 2n-20n
caused by non reduced gamete fomration, which is very rare in males and non viable.

most often flowering plants are polyploid, they are even specifically breed to have more chromosome sets as this usually increases fruit and flower size.


##### Examples

water melon
must be bread from a tetraploid(?) and a diploid to get a tripliod
infertile plant.

Kiwi fruit
12-16 copies

Strawberries
4 copies (tetraploid)

Frogs
_Xenopis levis_  4n
_Xenopus tropicalis_ 2n

NOTE: plants are better adapted to polyploid because:
1. they are not as confined to a set physical form so different in growth and development genes operation levels are not so important
2. they can reproduce vegetatively so polyploid individuals aren't as severely evolutionarily disadvantaged.
3. less precise sperm targeting is necessary.



#### Deletions
deletions often occur by chromosome breakage during the cell cycle. These deletions may be terminal of interstitial. If the centromere is lost, the
entire chromosome will be lost.

##### Piece of Chrome
sometimes multiple genes are lost when both strands break and a part of the chromosome is permanently lost. A specific deletion on chromosome 5. (where the entire p arm is deleted leads to a serious syndrome)

##### Cri du chat (5p-)
Frequency: 1/20000-50000
Effects:
1. Intellectual disability,
2. low muscle tone
3. microcephaly
4. distinctive facial features.
5. normal life expectancy  

#### Duplications
Cause: retro transposition, or non-allelic homologous recombination in repeat rich areas.

A small region of a chromosome is repeated, and placed next to the existing copy (in tandem). duplications tend to happen in high repetitive sequences of DNA. These repeated regions mean that the chromosome will note line up very well with its homologous pair.

passed on by unequal order, and may or may not have a phenotypic effect.


#### Huntington Purea
Repeats alter gene function, which can lead to brain damage.
Repeats may have a positive effect because they allow one copy of a gene to evolve independently, specialise in a different function while the original function is still conserved by the other copy of the gene.

#### Inversions.
Cause: non-allelic homologous recombination
Effects:
1.  pairing in meiosis occurs via looping
2. cross over in the looped region can cause major deletions or duplications.

#### Translocation
Effects:
1. novel chromosomes are generated
2. individuals are usually infertile.
3. can result in aneuploidy (such as 14q21q inherited down syndrome)
4.

##### terminal
A piece breaks off a chromosome and sticks to the end of a non-homologous chromosome.

##### reciprocal
Exchange of pieces between non-homologous chromosomes
#### Robertsonian

two Acrocentric chromosomes lose their short arms and get stuck together.

#### Fission
deletion (loss of acentric piece)'

#### Fusion
bicentric chromosomes (breakage in mitosis)

##### breakage fusion bridge cycles in cancer.
Copy image.
1. end of a chromosome breaks off (during meiosis)
2. one daughter cell inherits the chromosome lacking a telomere.
3. the new cell enters S phase and replicates its DNA (it now has two sticky DNA ends right next to each other.
)
4. loose DNA strands bind to form continuous DNA loop.
5. fused sister chromatids are pulled apart during mitosis, causing breakage at a new sight
6. one daughter cell inherits chromosome with duplicated genes and again a free sticky end. this cycle can then begin again leading to even further chromosome distortion.

#### Imprinting

##### Hinny vs mule

###### Mule
horse mother donkey father
hardy and obedient

###### Hinny
donkey mother, horse father.
temperamental, untrainable.

##### Intersistial deletion of chromosome 15

###### Prader -Willi syndrome
Cause: deletion from father, ZNF127 and IPW inactivated on the maternal copy.  
effects:
1. mental retardation
2. obesity
3. diminished growth.

###### Angelman syndrome
1. deletion from mother: UBE3A inactivated on paternal copy.  
2. mental retardation
2. epilepsy
3. lack of motor development.

#### X inactivation
the inactivation of one of two X chromosomes in females via DNA methylation.

NOTE: which X chromosome is inactivated varies randomly from cell to cell.this inactivation process turns the inactive X into a bar body, (highly methylated and rolled up in histone proteins).

## defining environments.
environments are a smooth continuum of suitable (good) to unsuitable (bad). There is a threshold below which conditions are too ad to sustain a particular organism, below this line there are no available habitats. above this  line there is spectrum of habitats varying from poor to good, with associated increase in survival and reproductive rates.

## Valence Bond Theory

### History
Valence bond theory was the First quantum mechanical theory
developed. It was developed by Walter Heitler, friz London and Linus Pauling, and helped to explain concepts which were poorly predicted by VSPER theory such as diamagnetic/ paramagnetic properties.

### Basics

#### Wave functions.
the wave function of an electron pair is formed by superimposing the wave function for the separate fragments of a molecule.

Wave functions behave like waves. they can be in or out  of phase and constructively or destructively interact.

##### Electrons
Each electron will have a wave function $\psi$  that describes the behaviour of that electron.
(section 1.2 in book)

the probability of finding an electron at any given location is given by $\chi= \psi^{2}$

$/chi$ is used to represent the orbital of a given electron.

##### bonds
each bond will also have a wave function which describes the movement of electrons within that orbital.

if there is a high probability of finding two electrons in the space between two nuclei then this implies a bond between these two nuclei.

###### examples

the bond between two hydrogen can be expressed as
$\psi= \chi_{A}(1)\chi_{B}(2)$
( or $\psi=\chi_{A}(2)\chi_{B}(1)$ is just as valid )



### Bonds

#### Background

1. All single bonds are $\sigma$-bonds
2. Double bonds contain one $\sigma $-bond and one $\pi-bond$
3. triple bonds contain one $\sigma$-bond and two $\pi$-bonds

#### degree of overlap
At some point the repulsion between nuclei exceeds the energy lost by bond formation.
Copy graph

NOTE: energy drop resulting from bond formation can be thought of as resulting from increased stability of the newly formed association.

#### multiple bonds
multiple bonds can form between two atoms


#### Sigma bond
a sigma bond is cylindrical around the internuclear axis.

#### Hybridisation
It might be expected that bonds formed from the overlap of 2 s orbitals and 1s + 1p would have different shapes and energy levels however it turn out they are identical, this is because of hybridisation, in which bonding (and non bonding) electrons are hybridised to the same energy level before any bonds are made. as as result when bonds are made there are all energetically identical.

##### Promotion
in order for hybridisation to take place electron must often be promoted from double filled lower orbitals to single fill higher energy levels. this is necessary as there must be as many lone electrons as there are bonds to be formed. the energy necessary for this promotion is regained by the increased stability of the final bonded structure.

###### Lone pairs
valence lone pairs must also be hybridised onto the same energy level as the bonding electrons.

##### types

###### sp
ground state 2s
1. promotion of s electron to get 1s and 1p
2. Hybridisation to get $sp$, this mean two bonds can be made and a linear molecule formed

###### $sp^{2}$
ground state 2s 1p
1. promotion of 1s electron to get 1s and 2p
2. Hybridisation to get $sp^{2}$, this mean three bonds can be made and a trigonal planar molecule is formed

###### $sp^{3}$
ground state 2s 2p
1. promotion of 1s electron to get 1s and 3p
2. Hybridisation to get $sp^{3}$, this means four bonds can be made and a tetrahedral molecule is formed.  

###### $sp^{3}d$
ground state 2s 3p
1. promotion of 1s electron to the p and then the d orbital to get 1s and 3p 1d
2. Hybridisation to get $sp^{3}d$, this means 5 bonds can be made and a trigonal bi pyramidal molecule is formed.

###### $sp^{3}d^{2}$
ground state 2s 4p  
1. promotion of 1s electron to the p and then the d orbital and 1 p orbital to the d orbital, to get 1s and 3p 2d
2. Hybridisation to get $sp^{3}d$, this means 6 bonds can be made and an octahedral molecule is formed.

### Pro's and Con's

#### Problems

##### delocalised orbitals
  (p orbitals can overlap they are not restricted to their atomic orbitals. )
##### megnetic fields

###### paramagnetic
elements with partially filled atomic orbitals are paramagnetic that is they are weakly attracted to whatever magnetic field they are in.

#### diamagnetic
diamagnetic have only completely filled atomic orbital, and weakly repel whatever magnetic field which they are in.

## Molecular orbital theory.
electrons spread over the whole molecule, and can interact with more than one atomic nucleus.
molecular orbital are created from the sum and the differnece of two wave functions.

### LACO's
linear combinations of atomic orbitals

#### bonding orbitals

The sum form the bonding orbital which lies between the two nuclei and is of lower energy

#### Antibonding orbitals
 The difference forms the antibonding orbitals, which are at higher energy then their respective atomic orbitals and lie on the outside of the molecule, between anitbonding orbitals there exists a point of minimum electron density (maximum destructive overlap) which is known as a node.  

NOTE: the increased energy is due to the fact that they can only interact with one nucleus and that they are slightly repelled to be father from this nucleus than normal by the increased internuclear electron density of the bonding orbital.

#### $\sigma$ orbitals
1. s-s (end to end overlap)
2. s-p (end to end overlap)
3. p-p (end to end overlap)

#### $\pi$ orbitals
1. sideways overlap of p orbitals

#### $\delta$ orbitals
1. fact to face overlap of $d_{xy}$ or d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}

### energy level diagrams
Pauli exclusion principles still apply.

NOTE: interaction between 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ from lithium to nitrogen.

#### symmetry
inversion symmetry (?)
not related to bonding/ antibonding
orbitals labelled with a subscript g or u.

#### gerade and ungerade
gerade= even, ungerade = uneven

for $\sigma$ orbitals the bonding is usually labelled $\sigma_{g}$ and the anti-bonding orbital $\sigma_{u}$

for $\pi$ orbitals
1. bonding = $\pi_{u}$
2. antibonding $\pi_{g}$

#### terminology

##### HOMO
highest occupied molecular orbital

##### LUMO
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

##### SOMO
singly occupied molecular orbital.
