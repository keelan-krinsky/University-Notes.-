# Problem#3
If male parent's mother was O then Male parent must have at least one
i allele.
If male parent is blood type IB then male parent must have at least one B allele.
hence male parent must be IBi.
If female parent is blood type A, she can not have inherited any IB from her
father. also as her father is blood type B she could not have inherited any IA
from her father either (as he doesn't have any).
hence she must have inherited allele i from her father, but as she is blood
type A she must have genotype IAi
## blood types of offspring
