many hydrogen bonds are formed which together gain considerable
strength.

Hydrogen bonds are typically up to \$ angstroms in length, which a
strength of 2-10kcal/mol.

NOTE: the advantage of hydrogen bonds is that they do not take too much
energy to break down so the body can readily re-purpose/recycle organic
compounds.

polar and a polar groups )

Examples

Integral proteins within the cell membrane are amphipathic, and allow
for non polar channels through the membrane.

fatty acids form micelles (globules) and bilayers in water.

A Premise is a statment. This statement may be true or false.

In science the orginial premise is known as the hypothesis. this
hypothesis will be tested, usually impirically.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%

A conclusion should be well supported by all premises. The conclusion
leads one to decide if the hypothesis is true fo false.

\hypertarget{a-good-argument}{%
\subsection{A good argument}\label{a-good-argument}}

A good argument can be deductively, or nondecuctive but abductively, or
inductively strong.

NOTE: Arguments can be invalid even if all of the premises and the
conclusion are true. If they do not actually imply eachother then it is
simply a collection of facts and not an argument.

\hypertarget{non-deductive-arguments}{%

most of science is actually non deductive reasoning. science will often
venture conclusions beyond the scope of observation (induction).

\hypertarget{inductive-reasoning}{%

In Inductive reasoning premises are veiw as strong support of the truth
of the conclusion. however they do not garuntee the truth of the
conclusion. Induction allows for conclusions to be made about issues
outside the scope of ovservation.

abductive arguments seek to explain what is observed, otherwise known as
inference to best explination.

\hypertarget{abductive-arguments}{%
\paragraph{Abductive arguments}\label{abductive-arguments}}

abductive hypothesies should be able to predict easily testable results,
such that if the predicted result is achieved during experimentation
then the validity of the hypothesis is supported, and if it is not the
hypothesis can be rejected.

(Abductive arguments usually rely on a number of assumptions which can
be supported by the predictive power of the argument)

NOTE: if testing two alternative theories H1 and H0 then a good test
experiment will be set up such that the the observation of event P
supports H0 and negates H1 and visa versa.

Inferences.}\label{evaluating-abductive-inferences.}}

\hypertarget{surprise-principles}{%
\subparagraph{Surprise principles}\label{surprise-principles}}

If an observation supports a hypothesis, then it must strongly favour
that hypothesis over others with which it competes

In order to satisfy this principle: 1. the hypothesis should make no
fasle predictions 2. Within the set of true predictions which the
hypothesis makes, there should be predictions which are expected NOT to
come true if the hypothesis is false (Is this not mixed up somewhere?)

\hypertarget{abductive-fallacy}{%

thatpoint away from the viewer. 4. horizontal lines reprisent atoms that

have it on the right side.

CORN.

along the line between th COO and N group, if R is left of the central
Carbon atom the antomer is L, if R is right the antomer is D.

Alternative if the molecule is orinetated with the H group dirrectly
behind the centeral carbon. then if CoRN reads clockwise the antomer is
a D amino acid, if it reads Anticlockwise it is an L amino acid.

R and S (find what R and S stand for)

more generally applicable

each atom around the central carbon is assigned a priority based on its
atomic number (lower atomic number \(\rightarrow\)) lower priority. (if
two atoms have equal atomic numbers then the atomic numbers of their
side groups are checked and so on outwards until an order can be
established)

Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Convention

Uses the R, S system but is still based on glyceraldehyde. 1. priorities
are assigned 2. the molecule is orientated so that the lowest priority
group is dirrectly behinf the central carbon atom. 3. if the remain
molecules arrange clockwise in terms of priority (highest to lowers) the
molecule is a R antomer, if they arrange counterclockwise the molecule
is a S antomer

NOTE: D sugars have the R conformation and L sugars have the S
conformation.
