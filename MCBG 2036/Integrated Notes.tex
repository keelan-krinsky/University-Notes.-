many hydrogen bonds are formed which together gain considerable
strength.

Hydrogen bonds are typically up to \$ angstroms in length, which a
strength of 2-10kcal/mol.

NOTE: the advantage of hydrogen bonds is that they do not take too much
energy to break down so the body can readily re-purpose/recycle organic
compounds.

free amphipathic molecules will associate in water to form hydrophobic
internal environments. molecules (amphipathic molecules contain both
polar and a polar groups )

Examples

Integral proteins within the cell membrane are amphipathic, and allow
for non polar channels through the membrane.

fatty acids form micelles (globules) and bilayers in water.

Certain bacteria, respond to antibiotics by releasing proteins which
punch holes in the cell surface membrane creating freely permeable pore
through which cell contense can leak out, and killing the cells.

\hypertarget{examples-1}{%

proteases only work if the have a water molecule imbedded within their
internal structure, without this one molecule the entire enzyme becomes
inactive.

other examples are reverse transcriptase and HIV protease and GST
(detoxifying enzyme) which all rely on water molecules to function.

\hypertarget{premises}{%
\subsubsection{Premises}\label{premises}}

A Premise is a statment. This statement may be true or false.

In science the orginial premise is known as the hypothesis. this
hypothesis will be tested, usually impirically.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

A conclusion should be well supported by all premises. The conclusion
leads one to decide if the hypothesis is true fo false.

\hypertarget{a-good-argument}{%
\subsection{A good argument}\label{a-good-argument}}

A good argument can be deductively, or nondecuctive but abductively, or
inductively strong.

NOTE: Arguments can be invalid even if all of the premises and the
conclusion are true. If they do not actually imply eachother then it is
simply a collection of facts and not an argument.

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{non-deductive-arguments}{%
\subsubsection{Non deductive arguments}\label{non-deductive-arguments}}

most of science is actually non deductive reasoning. science will often
venture conclusions beyond the scope of observation (induction).

\hypertarget{inductive-reasoning}{%
\paragraph{Inductive Reasoning}\label{inductive-reasoning}}

In Inductive reasoning premises are veiw as strong support of the truth
of the conclusion. however they do not garuntee the truth of the
conclusion. Induction allows for conclusions to be made about issues
outside the scope of ovservation.

\hypertarget{inductive-strength}{%

\hypertarget{deductive-arguments-1}{%

\hypertarget{abduction}{%
\subsubsection{Abduction}\label{abduction}}

abductive arguments seek to explain what is observed, otherwise known as
inference to best explination.

\hypertarget{abductive-arguments}{%
\paragraph{Abductive arguments}\label{abductive-arguments}}

abductive hypothesies should be able to predict easily testable results,
such that if the predicted result is achieved during experimentation
then the validity of the hypothesis is supported, and if it is not the
hypothesis can be rejected.

(Abductive arguments usually rely on a number of assumptions which can
be supported by the predictive power of the argument)

NOTE: if testing two alternative theories H1 and H0 then a good test
experiment will be set up such that the the observation of event P
supports H0 and negates H1 and visa versa.

\paragraph{Evaluating Abductive
Inferences.}\label{evaluating-abductive-inferences.}}

\hypertarget{surprise-principles}{%
\subparagraph{Surprise principles}\label{surprise-principles}}

If an observation supports a hypothesis, then it must strongly favour
that hypothesis over others with which it competes

In order to satisfy this principle: 1. the hypothesis should make no
fasle predictions 2. Within the set of true predictions which the
hypothesis makes, there should be predictions which are expected NOT to
come true if the hypothesis is false (Is this not mixed up somewhere?)

\hypertarget{abductive-fallacy}{%
\subparagraph{Abductive fallacy}\label{abductive-fallacy}}

A widely used and accepted expination is not necessary at all plausible,
(even if no competing explination exists)

\hypertarget{making-observations}{%
