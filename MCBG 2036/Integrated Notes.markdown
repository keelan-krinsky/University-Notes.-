# Scientific practice

## solutions

### electrolytic solutions
Ionic dissociation occurs when the addition of a solvent or energy in the form
of heat causes molecules if crystals of a substance to break down into ions.

### Osmotic effects.
spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane

### tonicity

#### hypotonic
lower ions concentration, high solvent concentration lower osmotic pressure

#### hypertonic
higher ion concentration, higher solute concentration, lower solvent
concentration, higher osmotic pressure

#### isotonic
equal osmotic pressure. and solute/solvent concentrations.

### Ideal Solutions
an ideal solution is a solution which has a enthalpy of solution equal to zero
NOTE: bonds forming releases heat energy.
FR: the concentration of water in a typical cell is 55molar.

### concentration measurements

#### molar/molarity/molar concentration
concentration of solute in a solution in terms of moles of solute per volume of
solution

#### molality
concentration of solute in a solution in terms of moles of solute per mass of
solvent.

#### Other measures.
%w/w weight of solute per weight of (solvent?)

%w/v weight per volume.

%v/v volume per volume.

#### osmolarity
concentration of solute as total number of solute particles per litre (?)

#### osmolality
Concentration of solute as total number of solute particles per kilogram.

####osmol
number of solute particles which contribute towards the osmolarity of the
substance.

##Life Molecules

### Basic list
* Carbohydrates (2%)
* Lipids (2.5%)
* Proteins (15%)
* Nucleic Acids (RNA 20% E. Coli < 10% mammalian DNA is functional )
* Inorganic ions (3% Salts, 1% small metabolites)
* water (70%)

### Water

#### general properties
covalent bonds.
dipole moment.

##### hydrogen bonds.
many hydrogen bonds are formed which together gain considerable strength.

Hydrogen bonds are typically up to $ angstroms in length, which a strength of 2-10kcal/mol.

NOTE: the advantage of hydrogen bonds is that they do not take too much energy to break down so the body can readily re-purpose/recycle organic compounds.

##### polarity
high polarity means water has a large ability to stabilise other charges

#####
auto ionisation.
water can auto ionise into hydroxide ions and hydronium ions, the concetrations of which in solution can be measured by pOH and pH respectively.  

##### Solvation of ionic and polar solutes

$Coulombâ€™s\ law: F = k\frac{ q_{1}q_{2}}{ Dr^{2}}$

Where D is a measure of solvent polarity.The higher the polarity, the greater the ability to stabilise charges. water forms solvations shells around each ion.

##### Solvation of apolar groups and molecules (the hydrophobic effect)
free amphipathic molecules will associate in water to form hydrophobic internal environments. molecules (amphipathic molecules contain both polar and a polar groups )

###### Examples

Integral proteins within the cell membrane are amphipathic, and allow for non polar channels through the membrane.

fatty acids form micelles (globules) and bilayers in water.

###### Septicaemia
Certain bacteria, respond to antibiotics by releasing proteins which punch holes in the cell surface membrane creating freely permeable pore through which cell contense can leak out, and killing the cells.


#### water and protein structure
water proteins can be buried in the interior of protein structures where they may furfill vital functions

##### examples
proteases only work if the have a water molecule imbedded within their internal structure, without this one molecule the entire enzyme becomes inactive.

other examples are reverse transcriptase and HIV protease and GST (detoxifying enzyme) which all rely on water molecules to function.

## Acids and Bases



### Bronsted and lowery
acids are proton donors
bases are proton acceptors.
difference between acid/base and its conjugate is a proton.

### lewis
acids are electron pair acceptors
bases are electron pair donors.

#### lewis bases
* alchohol
* organophosphates.

### buffering
relies on weak acids or bases which do nto fully dissociate.

# Scientific Reasoning

## Basic structures of an argument  

### Premises 
A Premise is a statment. This statement may be true or false.

In science the orginial premise is known as the hypothesis. 
this hypothesis will be tested, usually impirically.

### Conclusions
A conclusion should be well supported by all premises. The conclusion leads one to decide if the hypothesis is true fo false.


## A good argument 
A good argument can be deductively, or nondecuctive but abductively, or inductively strong. 

NOTE: Arguments can be invalid even if all of the premises and the conclusion are true. If they do not actually imply eachother then it is simply a collection of facts and not an argument.  

### Deductive arguments
$A \in B \wedge B \in C \rightarrow C \in B$

#### Conditional 
$\exists P \rightarrow \exists Q$

#### Contrapositive 
$\nexists P \rightarrow \nexists Q$

#### Converse
$\exists ~ Q \rightarrow \, \exists P$
