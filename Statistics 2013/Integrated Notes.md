# Basic notes on course
The course consists of two parts

## Descriptive
First block
Large data set, few summary measures, extract essential info from data

## Inferential
Second block

# Definitions

### Statistic
Value calculated from a set of sample data (latin letters used )
Descriptive summary measure for a sample

### Parameter
Value calculated from data about the entire population (greek letters are used )
Numeric description of characteristic of the population

### Population
Set of all items under investigation

### Target population
The entirety of the population of units which falls under the scope of the study/ population about which inferences are to be made.  

### Sampled population
 The section of the target population for which information is (can be) collected.

### Raw data
 Data which is unorganised numerically and remains in the form in which it was collected.

### Array
An arrangement of raw data in de/ascending order of magnitude.

### Randomness
Equal chance of selecting any member of the sample space.

### Range
the difference between the largest value (observation) and the smallest value (observation) of the data set

### Cluster
a group of points that fall very closer together

### Outlier
an observation of datum that is unusually far from the bulk of the data.

### Relative Frequency
Proportion of the data having a certain property. Relative frequencies give the proportion of the observations falling in a particular group.



# Exam notes
Exam is representative of the entire course.


# General background

## Summary of statistic process

### General
Collect data, organise, summarize, present (graphs and shit), analyse, interpret/valid conclusions, make decisions

### Collection
Collect data from a set of unit which are under identical conditions, but which nevertheless display natural random variation  .

### Sampling
A sample is taken if the whole measuring the whole population is unfeasible.
A sample should be unbiased/representative, ie it should have all of the same conditions as the population as a whole.

### Data

#### Quality

### Scales of measurement
All data can be sorted into one of the four scales of measurement,and appropriate methods can validly be performed on it to give a meaningful result.

#### Qualitative
Relating to separate categories.

##### Nominal Scale
Categorical

####### Examples
* gender type
* Colors.

NOTE: don't confuse the fact that the categories cannot be ordered with the fact that data points within a given category can be ordered.

##### Ordinal
categorical data that can be ordered/ ranked.

###### Examples
* Grades

#### Quantitative.

##### Discrete
Countable

###### Examples
* humans
* atoms
* (positive)integer numbers numbers.

##### Continuous
non- countable, smooth variation

###### examples
* time
* space
* (positive) real numbers.

##### Interval Scale.
difference between scale points is the same anywhere along the scale, however the zero of the scale is not the true zero (complete absence) of the variable which it measure.

###### Examples

* Fahrenheit scale  

NOTE: does this scale include discrete data?

##### Ratio Scale
both differences between scale points and ratio's of data values are meaningful, the scale has a true zero.

#### Selection method

##### Direct observation

##### interval methods

##### Experimentation
Data is generate though the manipulation of variables under controlled conditions data on the primary variable under study can be monitored and recorded while conscious efforts are made by the researches to control the effects of a number of influencing factors.

###### Examples
this method is usually used in Biology, Chemistry and other natural sciences

# Graphical Methods

## Background
graphical techniques are often used to convey statical information (results)  to the public who may wish to use them.

### advantages
* quick and easy to see what is going on
* easy to pick out trends

### Definitions

#### Range
the difference between the largest value (observation) and the smallest value (observation) of the data set

#### Cluster
a group of points that fall very closer together

#### Outlier
an observation of datum that is unusually far from the bulk of the data.

#### Relative Frequency
Proportion of the data having a certain property. Relative frequencies give the proportion of the observations falling in a particular group.

## Types of graphs
* Dot Plots
* Pie charts
* Line graphs
* Bar graphs.charts
I stem and leaf plots
* Histograms
* Boxplots.

### Dot Plot
A plot of values on a vertical or horizontal scale.
each number is represented by a dot and the dots must be distinct.

### Pie Chart
A circle divided into segments. the size of each segment is proportional to the importance of the data category of random variable relative to the whole. (normally used for categorical data)

### Line Graph
shows the value of one variable against another (usually time), used to investigate trends between two variables.

### Bar Chart
Presentation of the categorical or discrete data by means of bars/ blocks orientated side by side.

### Stem and Leaf plot
numbers are split into two parts. A group of digits from the left of the number (the leaf) and the remainder of the data (the stem)
leaves and stem are then arranged on either side of a vertical spacer.(|)


The graph requires a key to indicate where decimal point falls.  

Good for plotting discrete of continuous data with many observations (abut 15-300)

### Histogram
A histogram is constructed form a frequency table, with bar continuous on one another. The intervals are shown on the x axis, and the number of items/data points within each interval is shown if the u Y axis.  

A histogram is usually used for continuous variable but it can also be used to plot discrete variables. If it is used on a discrete variable then the variable is/ must be converted into a continuous variable.

####Advantages
Good for showing symmetry of data.


# R coding

## Background
Knowledge of R code will not be tested directly in the course, however examples of data put through r code will be given and must be interpreted.
