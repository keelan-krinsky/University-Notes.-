# Basic notes on course
The course consists of two parts
## Descriptive
First block
Large data set, few summary measures, extract essential info from data
## Inferential
Second block
# Definitions
### Statistic
Value calculated from a set of sample data (latin letters used )
Descriptive summary measure for a sample

### Parameter
Value calculated from data about the entire population (greek letters are used )
Numeric description of characteristic of the population

### Population
Set of all items under investigation
### Target population
The entirety of the population of units which falls under the scope of the study/ population about which inferences are to be made.  
### Sampled population
 The section of the target population for which information is (can be) collected.
### Raw data
 Data which is unorganised numerically and remains in the form in which it was collected.
### Array

# Exam notes
Exam is representative of the entire course.


# General background
## Summary of statistic process
### General
Collect data, organise, summarize, present (graphs and shit), analyse, interpret/valid conclusions, make decisions
### Collection
Collect data from a set of unit which are under identical conditions, but which nevertheless display natural random variation  .
### Sampling
A sample is taken if the whole measuring the whole population is unfeasible.
A sample should be unbiased/representative, ie it should have all of the same conditions as the population as a whole.

### Data
#### Quality
#### Type
The type of data will determine which methods can validly be performed on it to give a meaningful result.

Categorical data

Numeric data

Source
Selection method

# R coding
## Background
Knowledge of R code will not be tested directly in the course, however examples of data put through r code will be given and must be interpreted.
