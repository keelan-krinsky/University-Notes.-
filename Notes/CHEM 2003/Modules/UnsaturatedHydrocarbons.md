## Releavance 
abundant in nature, abundant in polymers, 

## Typical compounds 
alkenes and alkynes, polar and non polar 

## Alkene 

## Alkyne 
typically undergo addition reactions. 

### POolarity 
nonpolar 

## hybridisatiAon 
$sp^2, sp$

### typical reactions 
addition (act as nucleophiles. 

### Stability 
internal and highyl substitued are more stable. 

### Addition Reactions of Alkenes. 

#### Hydrogen halide
nucleophilic doubel bond attracted to hydren in the polerisded hydrogen haligen bond. H is incoperated $Br^-$ is illiminated, and a carbocation intermediate is produced (cannot isolate cation intermediate). 

The reaction will proceed through the more stable intermediates to form the major porduct (which is in some cases the sole product. regioselectivity is a process whereby more than one product is possible in a reactino but only one producit is formed or products are formed disproportionately, this process follows markovnikov addition. 

Anti-Markovnikov addition. 
radical reaction used 

COPY reaction path, 
RO-OR cleaves homolytically to form 2RO^\cdot. (oxygen used as relatively stable and safe to use, also only a catalytic (i.e very small) amount of initaitor is required (obviously far safer. 

hydrogen halide added to radicals, leading to homolytic cleavage resulting in the formation of alcohols and bromine radicals 

> NOTE: when a polar bond is treated with a radical it will drive the reaction leading to homolytic cleavage. 

### propagation 
the bromine radical will attch the alkene, by attacking either side. 

radicals are electron poor species. and so the more stable radical will be higher substituted, due to the electron donating alkyl groups. 
so regioselectivity will now favour the opposite product with the halogen on the primary carbon. another bromide is not normally added becuse the hydrogen radical is far less stable than the bromide radical (write out the general rule in terms of which one is added because of radical stability). 

### Addition ofA $Br_2$
although the bond is non polar the electrons in it are highly polerisable (due to large atoms) due to the formation a delta postive charge on one bromine which can act as a electrophile, to interact wit the double bond nucleophile. 

the reactivity of alkenes is relant on the weakness of $\pi$ bonds relatrive to $\sigma bonds$ so saturated compounds tend to be more stable. 

in the intermediate one of the lone paris on the bromine froms a bond to the adjacent cation to form a bromonium cation, (which is more stable). the $Br^-$ anoin can now add to the bromonium cation (it always adds to the opposite face of the molecule to where the inital bromine is, due to steric hinderance), (both sterics and electrons are playing a role bu the effect is predominately steric dirven. 

however in a saturated system, where there is free addition then which face is added to does not matter, addition in a ring however bromine will add on oppoistes of the ring, one above and one below the plane of the ring, and so a trans product will be produced.). 


## reaction of hydrogen with double bonds

the H-H bond is weakened by addhesion onto the platinum or paladium surface, the exact mechanism is not completely known, it is known that syn addition of H across the double bond occurs (i.e the two hydrogen add to the same side of the double bond )
the hydrogen, this is because the H-H bond is not long enough  for them to add on opposite sides, to reduce an alkyne to an alkene a posioned catalysted (posioned with some lead). alkynes undergo most of the same reactions but slower, both because of a very stable vinyl cation intermediate formed, and becuase the $C\equiv C$ trible bond is actually slightly stronger than the double bond.


### Oxonolysis
the $\pi$ bond gives its electrons to an outside oxygen neutralaisingf the chargew on the central oxone atom an intermediate is formed known as molozonie, moloxonide rearranges to form an ozonde. write out reaction with arrows. which can occur with $Zn/AlOH$ or $Me_2S$, the products are ketones and aldehydes, in an aromatic ring other double bonds will be cleaved before double bond, but if left for sufficent time then aromatic edouble bonds will also cleave. the advantage is that, as it is difficult to stop the oxidation of a primary alcohol at the aldehyde stage, oxonolysis gives an alternative.

the collapse of the oxonide to the aldehydes/ketones (the mecahnism with dimethyl sulphide is known, the Zonc mecahnism is less well understood).

an excess of oxone is used as working out exactly how much oxone is added can be quite difficult. carbon carbaon doulbe bonds are replaced with carbon oxyugen double bonds. in generak carbon carbon double bonds are replsaced by csrbon oxygfen double bonds

> NOTE manganate always oxidises to carboxylic acids. 

### Osmium tetroxide $OsO_4$
not catalytic requires molar equivalent. reacts will double bind electrons with $\pi$ bond reduce oxmium to Os 6. Oxyegn are sdelivered sin in due to steric confinment of the $OsO_4$ molecule.
