###  Electromagnetic waves 

#### Wave nature. 
Electromagnetic waves consist of and electric and magnetic field which oscillate orthogonally to each other, and orthogonally to the direction of propagation of the wave. 

#### Wavelength 
Wavelength is donated by $\lambda$ and measured in meters (sometimes nm are used such as when UV or visible light is being discussed). 
 
#### Velocity 
Speed is donated by $c$. The speed of light in a vacuum ($c_0$) is constant ($3.00 \cdot 10^{8}m\cdot s^{-1}$), normally the speed of light is given in $m\cdot s^{-1}$ 

#### Frequency
frequency is donated by $\nu$ (?) and is measured in Hertz (Hz) that is $s^{-1}$

#### Wavenumber 

Wavenumber is donated by $\overline{\nu}$, and is the reciprocal of wavelength. It is measured in $cm^{-1}$ and used most commonly in IR spectra.
