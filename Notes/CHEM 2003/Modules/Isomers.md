# Isomers

#### Structural isomers. 
Structural isomers are compounds with the same atomic composition and molecular formula, but different atomic arrangments.

#### Structural isomers

#### Stereo isomers. 

##### Conformational 
Conformational isomers are characterised by free rotation around a particular (C-C) bond, hence at least one single bond is required in the structure. Due to the free rotation the different isomeric forms can be rapidly interconverted. 

###### Staggered 
In eclipsed conformation, when view along the axis of the bond the groups attached to the atoms of the bond do not lie dirrectly behind eachother but are displaced by a given angle ($60^\circ$) 

###### Eclipsed. 
In eclipsed conformation, when view along the axis of the bond the groups attached to the atoms of the bond lie dirrectly behind eachother. 

###### Cyclic compounds 
cyclic compounds can also form coformational isomers which take on the boat, or chair conformation. 


##### Geometric
Geometric isomers require a rigidn unit such as a double bond ($\pi$ bond), or a cyclic compound which prevents free rotation.

###### Cis trans. 
In cis trans nomeclature the cis conformation has groups of higher proprity on the same size, the trans has them on opposite sides. ( higher priority is assigned to the group which is connected by the atom with the higher atomic number, if atomic number is equal then mass number is used))

###### Carn-Ingold Prelog (E,Z)
The Carn-Ingold Prelog system (C.I.P rules) are used to assign priorities.  higher priority is assigned to the group which is connected by the atom with the higher atomic number, if atomic number is equal then mass number is used. If the first atom is identical then the atomic weight of the next atom in the chain is compared. multiple bonds are considered as an equvalent number of single bonds to the given atom. 

If the higher priorety groups are on the same side then the molecule is in Z conformation (where Z stands for Zussamen/together). If the higher priorety groups are on opposite sides then the molecule is th the E, Enitgen conformation. 

##### Enantiomers (Optical isomers)

Moeluces whise mirror images are not superimposed. 

###### Requirements. 
$sp^3$ hybridised carbon, with four differernt substituents ()i.e a steric carbon. 

The sp^3 hybridised carbon must have four different groups attatched to it.(For example alanine). The resulting system is asymetrical, and will have a non-superimposable missor image. 


NOTE: the central carbon may be refferd to as a steriocarbon, a steriogentic centre or a hydrocarbon. 

###### Properties. 
Inantomers have practically identical(almost indistinguishable) physical and chemical properties are therfore very hard to separate. Furthermore Racemic mixture are hard to detect. This is porblematic as often one inatomer may be a powerful medical drug and the other may be seriously toxic. 

###### Polarised light 
inantomers will rotate plane polerised light differently. They will rotate the plane of polerised light to the same extend to one will rotate to the right (+, dextrorotatory) the other will rotate to the plane to the left (-, levorotatory)(equal but opposite). 

###### Optical activity 
optically active substances will rotate plae polerised light. A Racemic mixture is opticcally inactive.

NOTE: A Racemic mixture is a mixture containing an equal concnetration of both enantomers. 

###### Nomencalture. 
The + or - is prefixed to the compound name. The problem is that the + and - configuration are determined experimentally and cannot be determined dirrectly from the steriochemistry around the steriocenter.

A new system was developed to overcome this problem, the process for which is as follows. 

 #. Priorities are assigned to each group using the C.I.P rules. (note 1 is used for highest priorety, on to 2 etc). 
 #. The molecule is orientated with the lowest priority group at the back. 
 #. If the remaining 3 substituents run from highest to lowest clockwise then the isomer is on R configuration. 
 #. If they are arranged anticlockwise the entantomer is S. 
 
 Example: 
 Br>Cl>C>H
 
 #. Clockwise, R
 #. anticlockwise S. 
 
 NOTE: Flipping any two groups will result in the opposite entantomer. swapping inverts the configuration from R to S. 
 
 ## Diasteriomers. 
Occur if more than one steriocentre is present. Diastereomers are not mirror images.

(Copy flag diagram)
For a diassteriogentic centres there are a maximum of $2^n$
 stereoisomers. Half of these will be enantomers of the other half. 
all of the other relationships are diateriomers. 


## Tautomers 
tautomers are isomers which can readily intraconvert between each other.
