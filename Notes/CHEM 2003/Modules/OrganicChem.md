# Organic Chemistry 
 
## NMR. 

 ### SAmple preparation. 
COPY Image. 
Sample in a tube which spins rapidly, and is often in solution (solid state NMR is possible but not often used). The solvent must be chosen so as not to interfere. 

The most common solvent is deuterated chloroform. ($CCl_4$) is toxic, $D_2O$ and $CD_3CO_D$ are also used. (and several others copy)

### Electromagnet
jacket of liquid helium, and jacket of liquid nitrogen. 

## # Analysis

#### Number of signals

##### Chemical shift. 
Gives information about the groups surrounding the proton in question. Each different chemical environment gives a signal.
The first question is are the nuclei in question readily chemically distinguishable. In general it is easy to tell groups apart but more difficult within a group all attatched to the same atom and constantly rotating, (NMR cannot distinguish between them either). For all chemically equivalent  hydrogens/nuclei only one peak will be seen. For each set of protons in a unique environment a different peak will be seen.  The smae will apply to $^{13}C$ carbons. 

The height of the signal depends on the time of relaxation to ground state, as a general rule quanternary carbons will relax slower giving s smaller peak. 

#### Symmetry 
Symmetry implies there will be different nuclei in identical environments. 

In summary the position of signals depends on the environment of the nuclei, and the number of signals depedns on how many nuclei are non equivalent. 

#### Restricted rotation. 
Around a double bond consideration must be given as to what a given nuclei is cis and trans to. / 

NOTE: look at Claden the second addition. 

NOTE: even very similar groups which have a environment which differes to any degree will give a peak.


### Shielding. 
Electrons are charged and moving so can set up their own field around the carbon nucelus which will slightly modify the strength of the applied field felt. As a general rule the tiny local magnetic fields that are set up oppose $H_0$. So the effective field is $H_{\text{overall}}=H_0-H_\text{electrons}$. 

The extent of the field  reduction depends on the density of the electron cloud.

Each nuclei experiences a different magnetic field, even though the external field is the same and therefore each nucleus resonate at its own frequency. 
deshielded implies more of the applied field is felt. 

### Chemical shift. 
The scael is universal so adjusts to the strength of the magnetic field.  ie at 60mHz 1$\delta$ unit = 60Hz, at 300mHz 1 delta unit = 300Hz. , in general $\delta $ = 1 part per million. 


##### Referecne compound 
The compound tetramethylsilane the $\delta$ of $^{29}Si$ $^1H$ and $$^{13}C$$ are by definition given as zero.  by definition $\delta =\frac{frequency(Hz)-frequency TMS (Hz)}{instrument operating frequency MHz}$ 
Typically H is between 0 and 10 and $^{13}C$ $0<\delta <220$


NOTOE: the NMR is callibrated with tMS to give the zero reference value. with shielding $\delta$  will decrease this is upfield, conversely deshielding leads to increase in deshilding moving the peak downfield. 

ANy carbon nucleus surrounded by protons is normally fairly shielded as the protons share electrons about equally with the carbon. If the carbon is bonded to a electronegative atom deshielding will occur, conversely if the carbon is bonded to an electropositive atom it will be more shielded, as its electron cloud will be pulled closer to it. 





#### Electroinductive effect. 
Electronic effect transmitted through neighboring $\sigma$ bonds . the effect is still significant for about three bonds down the line. 

NOTE: the effect is additive. 

#### Unsaturation 
A ring current develops in the ring of an aromatic in this case the induced field of the $\pi$ electrons reinforces and does not reduce the applied magnetic field.
The same is true of alkenes, and in general all unsaturated compounds. The same applies to carbons 

NOTE: the protons of aldehydes are extrememly deshilded, the carbonyl carbon is generally the most deshielded carbon one will find.

NOTE: alykes are a little bit of an exception as there are not as deshielded as the alkenes , READ UP ON THIS. 

### Integration of signals 
NOTE: only applies to protons. 

The area under a peak is proportional to the number of protons giving rise to that signal. The instrument can integrate peak areas . INtegral is plotted as steops, the height of the steps are proportional to the number of protons, integration works with protons but fails with most othe nuclei. (esp $^{13}C$ )

The height signifies the number of protons, this height may nto always be exactly identical, this is not an issue and may result from some impurity in the sample. the ration between heights can then be found, the lowest whole number ration will be correct generally (as there must be a whole number and this number cannot exceed )

## Aspects of reactivity 

### Effects of bond polarity. 

#### Bond breaking. 
(manual section 18-22)

##### Non Polar bonds 
undergoes homolytic cleavage, reprisente by fish hooke arrows. More often than not homolytic cleavage gives rise to radicals. to make a bond each atom donates an electron.givesss rise to free radicals 


##### Polar bonds. 
one atom already has aaa dedlta negative bond sso someone takes all the electrons. In a heterolytic cleavage the two electrons go onto the side which is more electronegative (already delta negative charged ). heteroytic cleaavage gives rise to the formation of electrophiles and nucleophiles. electron move from the electrophiles to the neutrophiles. Electrophiles initiate the reaction. Most reactions stem from the 


ns effect transmitted through a $\sigma$ bond framework of molecules. 
as electrons spend more time on the electronegative atom this atom gains a delta  negative charge, the other atom in this bond will have a delta positive charge.  

the effect falls off after about 3 bonds. alkyl groups are electron donating, by induction.The electronic effects are donated transmitted by a sigma bond. 

alkyl groups are electron donating. 

Stability of carbocations and carboanions. 
If a carbon is carrying apositive chrge, additional alkyle groups attatched to this carbon will stabalise it by donating electrons to cangel out this charge. so tertiary carbocations are more stable thatn secondary which are more staable than primary. In the case of a carbon anion however the electron releasing effect of the alkyl groups will lead to a destabalising effect. a negative charge can however be stabalised by an electronwithdrawing group. with a free radical stability increases with more alkyle groups, 

inductive effect, occurs through a sigma structire 

mesomeric/ resonance effect. 
works through a $\pi$ bond  
a $pi$ bond is waeker than a $\sigma$ bond, becuase this bond is weaker is allows ofr resonance with fully charged structures where the more electronegative, atom tkes both electrons in the bond. resonance structure can be donated by dotted lines in which case it is known as a resonance hybrid. elcalisation of charge gives rises to resonance structure.

## Conjugated systems . 
(i.e alternating single and double bonds. ). COPY delocalised structure. radicals can be shifted around a structure in much the same way a a double bond. by homolytically breaking adjacent bonds, to from a new bond, and a new radical.
