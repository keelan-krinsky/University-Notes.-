 ### Addition polymerisation

# ### Initator 
requires radical initiator usually peroxides used to from oxygen centered radicals, oxygen can suuport that free radical, as oxygen radicals are relatively stable. (radical is only added in catalytic amounts, as they are highly reactive often reacting expthermically. 

#### propagatioAn 
the oxide radicals can attach the alkene leading to the formation of carbon centered radicals, theses  carbon centred radicals can attack other alkenes to form new radicals, (all the while the chai is growing as each time the radical attachs a bond is formed and the chain gets longer. ). 

controlling the chain length is important, as it determines the physical properties of the polymer.i

#### retrosynthesis 
working out the subsituents identify the boidlbe bond in the ring, the diane is centered around this nad the dieneophile can be infered, from breaking the ring. 


### Pericyclic Reactions 
Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction 

diene reacts with an alkene (typically with an electron withdrawing group), known as the diene of phile, the two eelctrons of the dienophile form a bond with the diene, soone of the diene bonds has to break, and reform adjacent, so the bond further along the ring must also break and a six membenrad ring is formed, it is a very useful reaction, as steriochemistry and regiochemistry can be controlled, also the presence of an alkene in the product allows for the addition of new products. 

#### For example. 

for example in thee reaction or cyclopentydiene, (there is not actually a perticular start or end point in this reactrion but it is easier to show as the )

alkenes are named starting with the first carbon participating in the double bond.

start at dieneophile, draw to first bond, theb push bonds around the dieneto form six membered ring.
