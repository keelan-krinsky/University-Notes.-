# Saturated Heteroatoms
A heteroatom is any atom aside from Carbon and hydrogen, a heteroatom compound is a compound containing at least one heteroatom. 

### Bond polarisation
If the heteroatom is more electronegative the carbon to which it is bonded will carry a delta positive charge. Where the heteroatom is less electronegative (such as with metals) the carbon to which it is bonded will carry a delta negative charge.


>NOTE: Organic compounds are compounds containing both carbon and hydrogen. 

### Important functional groups

#### halides 

C-X (F,Cl,Br,I)

#### oxygen

Alcohols (primary secondary and tertiary), ethers.

#### sulphur 
thiols 
sulfides

#### nitrogen 
primary, secondary and tertiary amines. 

### Reactivity 
Compounds contains a electrophilic carbon usually react with nucleophiles, whereas compounds containing nucleophilic carbons will react with electrophiles. The lone pairs on heteroatoms allow them to act as proton acceptors (lewis bases).C-X bond (Cl(326), O(351),N(366)) are much weaker than C-H bonds (413)

### Acid base properties

Alcohols can release protons from the O-H bond, so can act as acids but are often very weak. Ethers on the other hand have no acidic proteins so cannot act as acids. Primary and secondary amines can also act as acids donating protons attached tot he nitrogen. 

Alcohols will react with metals to from a metal hydrate and an alkyloxide.

### Basic behaviour 
alcohols can accept protons due to the lone pairs on oxygen forming an oxonium ion. Amines can also act as bases accepting protons with the lone pair of the nitrogen. 

### Substitution reactions
saturated heteroatoms will undergo substitution reactions for example the substitution of a halogen with by a $OH^-$ ion.
Substitution and elimination always compete with each other. In principle, this process is reversible so to favour the forward reaction a good nucleophile should be a poor leaving group. And a good leaving group should be a poor nucleophile. 

### Nucleophile strength
A good nucleophile tends to be a good base. (the aspect of nucleophilicity is governed by the electron distribution of the molecule) Full negative charge implies better base and hence better nucleophile. This also implies that more highly substituted nucleophiles will be better nucleophiles due to the electron releasing alkyl group. 

#### Down a group 
moving down a group nucleophilicity increases (although basicity decreases). Electrons on atoms further down experience less effective nuclear charge so are more readily donated.

### Moving across a period electronegativity decreases, as the more electronegative atoms hold onto their electrons more strongly and so donate them less readily. 

### Leaving groups
The weaker the C-X bond the better the leaving group. For anions normally the weakest bases are the best leaving groups. 
Groups which can from resonance structures are better leaving groups as they are more stable. OH is a very poor leaving group (COPY TABLE)
To displace OH groups they must be pronated to form water. For example $NaBr$ cannot replace OH but $HBr$ can as the OH group is first pronated becoming a better leaving group. 

> NOTE: As a weak acid implies strong conjugate and visa versa the acidity of the conjugate acids of two nucleophiles can be compared to determine the relative strengths. 

> Flow of electrons and transition states and well as stereochemical features must be considered. 

### Elimination vs substitution
The more basic the nucleophile the more likely it is to undergo elimination rather than substitution. In a substitution reaction the nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite the carbon.

### Temperature
Higher temperature will favour elimination.

this is because in the elimination reaction there are more products than reactant is to entropy increases, so as T increases $T\Delta S$ increases and $\Delta G$ decreases making the reaction more spontaneous.

#### Size
The more bulky/branched the substrate the more likely elimination is to occur as substitution is sterically hindered. 
A large nucleophile will also promote elimination due to steric considerations.

>NOTE:there is a fundamental difference between nucleophiles and bases. Nucleophiles are defined kinetically, i.e. the strength of a nucleophile is related to how fast it will react. Bases are related to thermodynamics, i.e. how strong the bonds formed will be. 

### $S_N$ reactions
nucleophilic substitution reaction

#### Leaving group 
Good leaving group promotes reaction.


#### $S_N1$
Unimolecular

In the $S_N1$ reaction the leaving group leaves before the nucleophile attacks. Two step process proceeding via a carbocation intermediate. The Rate of the reaction is dependant one reactant. Weaker nucleophiles prefer the $S_N1$. Only one reactant in the rate ordering step. Second order Kinetics, two reactants are involved. 

##### Energy Profile of Reaction
Contains two humps,as two steps, between the two humps is the energy carbocation intermediate. 

##### Stereochemistry
A carbocation is $sp^2$ hybridised with a trigonal planar. As the nucleophile can attack from either side a racemic mixture is produced. 

##### Effect of nucleophile
The nucleophile has no effect on the rate

#### $S_N2$
Bimolecular
The nucleophile attacks and the leaving group leaves simultaneously. The rate of the reaction is dependant on the concentration of both reactants.Stronger nucleophile prefers the $S_N2$ reaction.

##### Intermediate Stability
The more stable the intermediates (i.e. the carbocation), the more likely $S_N1$ reaction is to occur. 

##### Stereochemistry 
The nucleophile approaches the molecule from the opposite charge from the leaving group, which leads to inversion of the current stereochemistry around the central carbon. By default tertiary carbocation will normally undergo $S_N1$ reactions. 

##### Steric Hindrance
As other groups bonded to the positively charged carbon of the carbocation then there will be more steric hindrance hence carbocation are favoured by secondary carbon cations. By default primary carbocation will normally undergo $S_N2$ reactions.

##### $S_N2$
Good nucleophiles promote $SN_2$ reactions.

#### Protic solvents
Protic solvents promote $S_N1$ by stabilising (through donation of charge from high electron density areas of surrounding solvent molecules) the Carbocation. Water and methanol are good protic solvents, an hydration shell is formed. 

### Base induced elimination
The nucleophile acts as a base attacking the hydrogen, dependant on the reactant structure different products are possible. The major product formed will be dictated by the stability of carbocation. Zietzef's rule. Geometric isomers may be formed, the trans isomer will be more stable as there is less steric hindrance.
