# Saturated Heteroatom Compounds

## Electronic Structure
the delta negative nucleophile is in the $\pi$ bond, however with heteroatoms this bond is still polar. 

## Reactions 

### Strong  Nucleophile 
If a strong nucleophile is used then the nucleophile atoms will donate before the $\pi$ atoms of the substrate. A grignard reagent is used to obtains a carbon nucleophile. This nucleophile can attach the carbon of the heteroatom double/triple bond to form an organic oxonium ion in a salt with the remainder of the grignard reagent. This salt is stickily and prone to hydrolysis so is usually worked up to an alcohol for storage of further reaction.

Grignard reagent made by an insertion reaction between an alkyl bromide and magnesium.

#### Hydride nucleophile 

##### Reagents. 
The hydride will attack the electrophilic carbon and the resulting oxonium ion will take a hydrogen from a water. There reagent are used in preference of hydrogen gas with a catalyst as they are cheaper, and in some instances may reaction more specifically (not interfere with the rest of the molecule) where $H_2$ gas would.

###### $NaBH_4$ Sodium borohydride
Cannot reduce esters or amide (weaker reducing agent than $LiAlH_4$)

###### $LiAlH_4$ Lithium aluminium hydride

### Weak nucleophile
Typical weak nucleophiles include $H_2O$, $ROH$, $RSH$. Catalyst required with, $H^+$ addition to the oxygen leading to a resonance structure in which the charge on the carbon has increased (the electrophile has been activated), so it is more reactive. 


This reactions may be reversible. 

#### Acetal Formation
requires the addition of two alcohol equivalents to an aldehyde. 

Some reactions involve masking a functional group for example with a acetyl,performing the reaction, and then unmasking it. 

Addition of an alcohol leads to O addition to the electrophilic carbon to form a hemiacetal intermediate. Theses intermediates are highly unstable, with the OH of the newly formed alcohol protonating, and water removing as a leaving group. All of the reactions involved however are equilibria. The second equivalent of the alcohol then adds to the electrophilic carbon to form an acetal.

Sometimes with a diol formation of a cyclic acetyl compound will occurs


>NOTE: the second alcohol may also be protonated and deprotonation but no reaction follows from this protonation. 
>NOTE: protonation and deprotonation occurs constantly in solution. 
> NOTE: Protonation exists as an equilibrium 
> NOTE: Do not confuse equilibrium with resonance arrows. 

Substitution
Addition followed by elimination leads to an overall substitution, where for example an carboxylic acid can be attacked by an amine, Acid catalysis typically is required to protonated the oxygen afterwards, and the elimination of water to form a imine. The reaction only works for primary amines. $N-HH_2$ forms a hydrazone, and $N-OH$ forms a oxime. 


# Canonical forms 
resonance structure. 

Can reduce amides and ester (stronger reducing agent than $NaBH_4$)

## Aldehydes

### Formation 
Can be made by oxidation using a mild oxidation reagent, such as PCC.


### Tautomerism
in general enols are less stable than ketones so will typically tautomerism to their keto form (typically less than 0.1\% in the enol form ).
Interconversion occurs via donation of O lone par to carbon followed by proton transfer to the adjacent carboanion formed

Substitution at the $\alpha$ position can be done by the enol/keto transfer. 

If the $\alpha$  carbon is bonded to a hydrogen it can be deprotonated by a base to form a carbanion (enolate anion) which is stabilised by resonance. Enolate ions are 

NOTE: only the protons of the $\alpha$ carbon can be removed, as removing the hydrogen of the carbonyl carbon does not lead to a stable ion/ it is not an acidic proton. 


## Aldol Reactions 
Treatment of Aldehyde as a base. (normally not OH^- as $NaOH$ soluble in water and organic substrate is not). The nucleophilic carbon created attaches the electrophilic carbonyl carbon,.water is then added to the oxanion and elimination of $OH^-$ may leave to from an alkene, this is base catalysed dimerisation and the trans alkene is the major product as it is more stable. The elimination is an E1 elimination to on a enolate anion formed from deprotonation. 

Aldo reactions can be between two molecules of the same time, or within one molecule to form a cyclic product with a suitable sized ring.
