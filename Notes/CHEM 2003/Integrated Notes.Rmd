## Background

###  Lecturer
Dr Kennedy Ngwira, C407, Dr Amond Rouseou. C503. 

## Inorganic Chemistry

## __InorganicChem: Inorganic Chemistry__

## Spectroscopy 

## __Spectroscopy: Spectroscopy__

## Organic chemistry

## __OrganicChem: Organic Chemistry__

## Spectrometry

## __Spectrometry: Spectrometry__

## Reaction types

### Substitution 
nochange in the level of saturation

### Elimination 
decreased level of saturation

### Addition
increased level of saturation

## Examples
Reactions which go through more stable intermediates will proceed faster.for $S_N2$ more powerful nucleophile. For $SN_2$ reaction, polar aprotic solvents aid $SN_2$ more than polar protic solvents. 

Remember $S_N1$ leads to racemic mixture, $S_N2$ leads to inversion of current stereochemistry. 

Steric hindrance, nucleophile, electrophilic carbon, bulky methyl groups.
