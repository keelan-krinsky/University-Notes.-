title: "Continental Drift"

## Stage one 
175 mya (some controversy over time), Pangea with the Tethys sea in the east. 

## Stage 2 
Gondwawna and Laurasia formed

## Stage three
Laurasia split when north America/ Greenland broke free from Eurasia opening filled by the Norwegian sea, the Atlantic and Indian oceans 	

there is far less free mixing of water, a number of relatively isolated basins. 

To confirm the theory matches are found between geology as well as fauna and flora similarities. Prince Edward mountains example of landscape change. 

Copy diagram of plate movement, some plates are more active than others, the Himalayas are still growing. Tsunamis caused by large slips in plate position.

rock age analysis shows newest rock directly along ridges which supports the theory 

## Movement Types

Plates can converge 
such as in subduction where one plate slides over another. Lower plate is forced down, and metals, releasing very hot water under high pressure which can push up to form granite domes or surface volcanoes/ islands or even continental zones.

When plates collide orogenesis(the formation of mountains often occurs. )

Denser plate (i.e oceanic plate) generally slides underneath

As well as mountains very deep trenches can also from subduction, such as ocean trenches can go over 11000 meters dive. The deepest submarine dive was 11521 meters.


Surfacing two fast air comers out of body in bubbles, too high pressure can also burst lungs. 
Divergent 

Plates may also slide past each other without creating or releasing lithosphere, tent to get stuck on each other the massive release of energy as they slide past. 

NOTE: in formation of the crust the added weight helps to push crust back down.

### Wilson Cycle 
process of rock formation and melting.

#### Stage 1
stable plate

#### Stage 2
early rift

#### Ocean basin formation 

#### subduction of ocean plate

$$$$ Continental crust slide further along ocean crust colliding with another Continental crust to form a poniplage mount and then finally back to a stable crater.

Tsunami's normally occur from disturbance in subduction areas as the subducting plates cannot flow smoothly past each other due to friction. The overriding plate if stuck for a long time begins to bend, and can snap back very fast, leading to tsunamis. Tsunami's move at about 700 km per hour.
