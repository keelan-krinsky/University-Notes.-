# Coriolis Effect
 As earth is curved the spin of the earth deflects anything moving over its surface. Large scale motions, are deflected to the left in the southern hemisphere and right in the northern hemisphere. 

 >NOTE: It would more more accurate to say that all motions are deflected but that the deflection is only significant for large scale motions.
