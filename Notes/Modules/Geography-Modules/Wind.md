# Wind

>NOTE: Wind is taken into consideration when planning journeys, with an attempt to travel along jet streams in aeroplane flight. 

## Causative Factors
Wind patterns are predominately driven by pressure differentials resulting from temperature differentials, which in turn result from orientation of earth with respect to the sun.

### Hadley Cell
The equator recipes the highest intensity of incident solar radiation, as solar radiation travels the shortest path through the atmosphered to reach the equator by comparison to any other area on the surface of earth. The incident radiation heats there air which then rises as its density decreases. The rising area leaves behind it a low pressure system. When the rising air reaches the troposphere it spreads out in both directions and begins to cool, This air travels for a long time north/ south at this altitude but eventually cools suffice inly to descend. By this stage all of the water vapour which was in this area has been lost as precipitation, so the descending air is very dry. As such, a high pressure, low rainfall system is established at around 30 degrees latitude. Some of this descending air will then move over the surface of the globe back to the equator due to the pressure differentially now in place. This circulation pattern form the Hadley cell, which is characterised by very heavy/strong winds. 

### Ferrell Cell
The Farrell cell sits in-between polar and Hadley cell, as is characterised by far weaker (surface) winds. 

### Polar Cells
By the poles dry area descends moving outwards across the surface of the earth and warming up as it does so. This warm air eventually rises at about 60 degrees latitude. The polar region is characterised by strong (surface) winds. 

## Effect of Coriolis Force
The Winds within the three circulation cells, leading to the formation of a number of important winds and zones. 

### Trade winds
Trade winds are equatorial easterlies. 

### Polar easterlies 

### Westerlies
Blow within the Ferrell cell and are usually weaker than easterlies. 

#### Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)/ dolderans 
The Intertropical convergence zone exists around the equator and is an area of very low wind as all of the air is rising and not blowing along the surface. 

### Tropic of Capricorn 
The converge zone between the equatorial easterlies and the westerlies in the southern hemisphere. 

### Tropic of cancer
The convergence zone between the equatorial easterlies and westerlies in the northern hemisphere. 

### Arctic circle
In the northern hemisphere

### Antarctic circle
In the southern hemisphere. 

### Horse Latitudes
Horse latitudes occur at 30 degrees, and have very little wind due to the high pressure system of descending air. 

>NOTE: The name derives from the Spanish war fleets forced to eat their own horses for survival when stuck in this zone. 

## Natural disasters
Very strong localised circular wind patterns are categorised by where they appear. 

### Hurricanes 
originate in the Atlantic 

### Cyclones
Cyclones originate in the Indian ocean. 

### Typhoon 

## Ecological effect

### Equatorial region
Equatorial areas are typically monsoon areas due to high evaporation rates, leading to hot moist air rising and loosing its water vapour in the form of precipitation as it cools. 

### $30^\circ$ latitudes 
The high pressure system of descending dry air leads to very low precipitation, and the formation of deserts.
