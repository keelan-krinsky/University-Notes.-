## Double Bond Equivalents 
The advantage of double bond equivalents is that they can be used to at least propose several possible structure for a compound. The presence of several structural components including double or triple bonds, cyclic compounds and aromatic rings can be speculated, and the related functional 
groups identified. 

### Aromatics. 
The DBE for a benzene ring is 4, and in general if a compound has a DBE above 4 there is a good chance that it contains benzene, (if its DBE is below four then obviously it cannot contain benzene.)
