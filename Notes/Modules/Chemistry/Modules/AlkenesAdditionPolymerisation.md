# Addition polymerisation

# ### Initator 
requires radical initiator usually peroxides used to from oxygen centered radicals, oxygen can suuport that free radical, as oxygen radicals are relatively stable. (radical is only added in catalytic amounts, as they are highly reactive often reacting expthermically. 

#### propagation 
the oxide radicals can attach the alkene leading to the formation of carbon centered radicals, theses  carbon centred radicals can attack other alkenes to form new radicals, (all the while the chai is growing as each time the radical attachs a bond is formed and the chain gets longer. ). 

controlling the chain length is important, as it determines the physical properties of the polymer.
