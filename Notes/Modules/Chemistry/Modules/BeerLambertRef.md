# Beer-Lamber Law.
The Beer Lambert law related the attenuation of electromagnetic waves to the properties of the material through which they are propagating and the distance which they have propagated through the material. 

## Equation.
For a particular wavelength the Beer Lambert law is given by:\newline 

$A=\epsilon bC$

Where: \newline 

> $A$ = Absorbance \newline 
> $\epsilon$ = Molar absorptivity ($L\cdot mol^{1-}\cdot cm^{-1}$)\newline
