# Mass Spectrometry

In not a spectroscopy becuase it ddoes not involllve bsorption of electromgnetic raiation. it is usedd to determine the molecular mass of a compound. Structural information can also be gained by looking at fragments  formed when high energy molecules break up. 

mass spec allows for measurment by rrent ion, high resoution pectraa allow for distighing between different molecular formulma of similar compounsd. Many are desktop size, gass cromotographers are often combined with the sspectrometer. 

Blast molecule with a beeam of high-energy particles (usually electrons). 
$\approx 70eV=6700kJ\cdot mol^{-1}$ 
deflection is dependant on bothe mass charge ration, those difflected insufficiently or too much will not be een the rgestpeaal cp,es from the paA
These dislodegg a valence electron from the molecule, leaving behind a radical cation. 

$M:\rightarrow M^{+}_\cdot +e^-$. 

the molecular ion is only one of the possible fragments, fragmentation patterns are consistent and therefore diagnostic, relating to the strength o bonds in the compound, lone pair or $\sigma$ or $\pi$ bonds caan be disodgen and the parent ion can furthe break down, charged and neutral fragments.

The istrument decetcs all positive ions and sorts them according to mass charge ratio, usuallt +1 charge in samll moelcules with mlarger chargers on polymers .

the parent will have the same mass as the largest radical mass fragments. (do not use the average molecular mass for low res max spec use the appropriate integer value
C-C bonds are weaker than C-H bonds so cleavage is far more likely to occur at C-C bonds than at C-H bonds. 

### Relative abundance
everything is judged in relation to the largest peak which is given a value of 100\%. 

oulby chraged fragments reulting rom ionition o rgment by chrged prticle i rre in small molecules as thier fragemnts are very unstable. 

each line derrives from a different ion. the pecific iotope compoition i een in the ms spec.isotomes can lead to higher mass fragments such as carbon 13. (he average value cannot be used in this case. )

n the case of carbon the abunadnce is 1.1% in bromine it is 50\% ($^{79}Br$, $^{81}Br$). 
(there will be doulbed peaks for all fragments which contain bromine. ). 

Chlorine, $^{35}Cl$ 75\% $^{37}Cl$ 25\%.
