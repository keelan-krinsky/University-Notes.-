# Fungi

# Fungal Taxonomy 

## Phyla 

## Acoso

## Fungal cell strucvture
Some species are dimorphic, they can grow as unicellular yeast or as multicelluar filamentous structures.

### Unicellular 
yeast

### Filametious 
multicellular

## Fungi Cell Structure
Can be multinucleate

### Apex 
Polerised, cell polerisationand the location ofthe spitzenkper are used in conjuctionto determine the dirrection of growth. 

### Spitzenkorper
Small structure near the apex required for rapid hyphal extension (studines invovling delteed genes for the structure lead to much lower growth rates). The structre is not required for hyphal polerisation. Acts as the vesicle supply center, exocytotic vesicles bud out from the spitzenkoper. Exocytotic vesicles also bind to the spitzenkorper and to merge with the cell membrane, all membrane are derrived from the golgi, ( the cellular organisation anddistribution center of the cell).  

## Fungal Growth

### Filamentious fungi
grow by hyphal extentioin wich is foward growth from the tip of the hyphae, this is a continuous prcoess which is not linked to nuclear division. 

#### Models 

##### Ameboid model
Extends in a similar fashion to the ameboid moviment. 

##### Steady state model 
Chitin in the tip has not yet formed strong bonds so is flexible, which allows for growth. 


##### Vesicle supply center (preffered model)
The hyphae contain a structure at the tip which regulates the vesicle supply. 

##### COmbination
The hyphal tip/apex grows forward. 

Enzymes packaged into vesicles are taked\n to the spintzencouper such as chitin synthase 3, which is required for cell wall growth.  

Exocytosis
added membrane+protein to cell wall + enzymes secreted. (the majority of reabsorbed enzymes are sent back to the tip,fro where they may be sent to protein degradation or dirrectly reused).

##### Endocytosis 
As growth is energy expensive to conserve energy enzymes are recycled,as hyphae move foward enzymes excreted are now relatively furtherback on the hyphage, they endocytose back into the cell and are recycled.

> NOTE: golgi in fungi are called gogi equivalents. 

pivotal role in vesicle trafficking 
source of exocyitic vesicles, and journey for some endosomes. Localised to the hyphal apex actin/cytoskeleton dependant process. golgi is responsible for polerisationandare essential for hyphal growth. 

Turger pressure
hydrostatic pressure of membrane against cell wall. Turger pressure is usedto penetrate barriers, both for the purpose of more effecient nutrient digestion (increased surface area touching food), and for pathogenesis, especially of dimorphic fungi.

## Dimorphic fungi
Most are thermodimorphic, i.e they have temperature induced shifts, normally switching from filamentous formin the cold to filamentous at high temperatures. Some switch the otherway round. The morphology shift can also be induced by albumen, pH nutrients, hypoxia, $CO_2$ and N-
