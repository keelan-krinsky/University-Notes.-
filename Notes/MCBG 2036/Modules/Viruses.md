homework: look over transcription and translation.

## Background 
All viruses are oblige parasites, they cannot survive outside of a living cell, (or maybe more accurately cant replicate). 
Viruses are acellular and obligate paracites. they do not have any cytoplasm or nucleous. 

Some viruses can survive for a long time outside the boy but none can replicate. 

The translation system of the cell is required for viral replication. 
NOTE: Use the work replicate rather than reproduce,  as replication is dependant. 

### Ebola virus. 
Comes from bats, it took a long time to find the source of the virus. 

## Structure of Viruses. 

### Size
A human blood cell is on average 10,000nm. a bacterium i 3000 x 1000nm. 
Viruses have a very large size range, some of the largest, such as Ebola are 970nm, some of the smallest are 225nm or rabies 170-70nm. 
10 -100 times smaller than a bacterium 

### Shape 
There is a diversity of shape within viruses, but the majority have the icosahedral shape. 

the size of the virus differs, and the membrane has a more amorphous shape, inside the envelope the viruses can either be icosohedral or helical. Viruses must pack proteins within the cell, but very little is known in this area, it differs between viruses, some wrap around DNA , some first build then squash DNA in. The capsid proteins, 
Increasing size of trinagles means increasing size of polypeptide

T is the number of triangles, F is the number of subdivisions. and p is the number of peptides. (number of subunits = $T^f$ ) T=3 means p=3 and f=1 T=1 (P f are 1)
check slide. 

#### Helical
long rod, some are straight and inflexible, some are long some short some thick some thin. Most helical viruses are ssRNA. The nucleic acid forms a helix with the capsid proteins packaging around the helix. sometimes the origin of packaging starts in the middle but usually start towards one end and form the package going one way. 

Assembly of the helical virus. capsomers form a disk, due to pH and possible other drivers. the nucleic acid gets threaded into the disk, and as the disk grows up it pulls the nucleic acid through the already formed disk up with it. At the very end the 5- end is pulled up through the loop. 

### Enveloped virus. 
Influenza virus has a thick envelope derived from the cell membrane. 
A envelope is polymorphic and may or may not contain spikes. 

## Influenza 
RNA virus., 7 or 8 different pieces of RNA, all contained together within one coat protein, packaged within the envelope.

## Rhabdoviridae
Such viruses are ssRNA negative stranded. Single stranded RNA- lyssavirus is an example which causes rabies. 

### Icosohedral capsids are made of of multipe protein subuntis or capsomer subunits which assmeble through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. 
subunits can be made up of several smaller identical or non identical polypeptides. The polypeptides making up the coat pack very specifically on these faces 
5 triangles at the top ten in the middle and 5 at the bottom, it has 12 verticies. five fold axis from the top/bottom and three fold axis from the sides. 
viruses can have up to three different polupepties. In speciic plant virus, one on each vertix. 

The epitome is a domain of the viral proteins recognie by the host, such  spike and membrane proteins. The polypeptide of the virus must bind to the receptor of the host. 


NOTE: proteins with five subunits joining is a pentamer, those with size are hexomers. 

The icosahedral is a minimal energy structure, based on geometric symmetry, (the geometry of shape). 

### Constituents. 

#### Nucleic acid

Not a nucleus but do contain genetic material, which can be DNA or RNA. Furthermore the DNA/RNA may be single or double stranded, and linear or circular. 
Forms a ball, there is an electrostaatic force between the nucleic acid and the protein which hold the nucleic acid in place. 

The DNA/RNA will form a helix with tertiary levels or structure, even single stranded. 
COPY IMAGE.


Viruses with more than one nucleic acid molecule are called segmented/multipartate, most viruses contain only one molecule of nucleic acid. All of the viral nucleic acids are required as they are nonredundant. Viruses can swap RNA molecules. 


_Mastadenovirus_
20 triangles to make up a basic iscosahedron, the triangles are the same size and the protein subunits pack symmetrically within a subunit, (one at each corner), larger triangles and larger polypeptides. the individual traingles can also be made up of four triangles. so they are all symmetrical. 

#### Protein coat. 

The protein coat surrounds the viral genetic material and protects it from degredation. A nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat formt he virus particlce/ virion, these proteins pack together in a highly symetrical structure, The envelope around this may obscure the shape. the virus proteins form around the particle through the interaction of electrostatic forces, dependant on PH (and other folding diverse, entropic collapse?). 

## Herpes virus. 
very large virus. some viruses have a matrix (made up of proteins) inside the membrane (HIV also has a matrix). 


#### Envelope. 
not all viruses have envelopes. 
the envelope is generally taken from the host cell membrane, through the process of endocytosis and exocytosis.
have a gene which codes for envelope proteins, which move into the envelope after the virus buds out. 

For example with HIV, Influenza and ebola are enveloped, this makes them more infectious as they are harder to recognise.

some viruses also have spikes which stick out from the membrane. In multicellular organisms such as humans as plants most viruses can replicate only in one type of cell, HIV can replicate in many, Influenza however is specific to respiratory. Generally viruses tend to be tissue specific, and also tend to be host specific, Rabies is an example of an exception. HIV come from primates and adapted to humans, Zoonosis/ a cross over virus. Influenza can replicate in pigs, ducks horses and birds. (Influenza has killed more people in the history o humanity than HIV)

The type o host/tissue depends on the type of attachment, such as CD4 in HIV, without the receptors on cell membrane for the virus infection will not occur.
The host must also contain the cellular factors such as replication machinary which can support the viral replication. Small differences in enzymes, (amino acid sequence) can imply that a virus cannot replicate within that cell. 
Viruses co-evolve with their hosts, (originated many different times within evolution). For example HIV had to recognise a receptor on human cells, but humans 98\% similar to primate. Fist adapted to a receptor called Tetherin, emmerged in the 1950s, but was in humans for a much longer time to adapt, but it didn't cuase infection for a long time. 

Many viruses will go extinct with their hosts, such as dinasour viruses.

### Virus strain, 
slight mutations, HIV for example has lost of strains, subtype C is prevalent in south africa. 

### Evolutionary
Viruses replicate and adapt very quickly. 

## Infection 

### Receptor binding. 
Mutations lead to better mutations, (via dirrected mutation, as opposed to spontaneous adaptation). 

## Bacteriophages. 
viruses which infect bacteria. 

## Viruses and diseases 
(note this links intimately with the immune system). 



## Triangulation number? 
What it actually consists of is unclear, it relates more to the number of axies than the number on the face. 

## Bacteriophages
Bacteriophages are the most 

### Classifcation 
based on their genome, bacteria phages are based on their genome, the most prevalent are dsDNA. 

Very interesting bacteriophages are found within extreme environments, these tend to have different shapes


### Life cycle 

#### Cryptic viruses. 
Evade the immune system, however once they enter their replicative phase the cell generally dies. 


 #### Lytic cycle, 
A phage which reproduces only by the lytic cycle is called a virulent phage. 
COPY IMAGE

##### Attachment 
phage attaches by tail fibres to host cell

##### Penetration 
phage lysozyme opens cell wall tail sheath contract to force tail core and DNA into cell (lysosymes used to soften cell wall)

##### Biosynthesis 
production of phage DNA and proteins ()transcription + translation

##### Maturation 
assembly of phage particles 
DNA enters the capsid, the mechanism is not well understood, and can undergo errors. 

NOTE: the size of the genome has to fit the capsid, however there is some leeway, and sometimes some bacterial host DNA can be packaged with it.

##### Release phage lysozome break cell wall (rather soften it)

##### Generalised transduction
sometimes bacterial genome gets chopped up and some of it is packaged within virions, provided it is the right size, This DNA can be inserted into another bacterium, and recombination can take place, or the DNA cacn exist as a plasmid. in this fassion 

NOTE: Conjugation also be used to transfer DNA. 
#### Lysogenic cycle 
Integrated within host genome, and replicates with it. 

NOTE: bacteria do have a defence against phages, in the form of restriction enzymes which recognise and cut up phage DNA


#### Lysogenic cycle 
Integrate and do not cause the cell to burst. Some phages can switch into the lysogenic life cycle. 
the lyogenic cycle repicaatess the phge genome without destroyinh the hosst, the virl DDN molecule is incorpaarated into the host cell's chromossome. This integrated viral DNA is known as a aprophage. everytime the host ivides it copies to daughter cells. some phages can switch to lytic cycle and ca take some host DNA with it (specialised transdyction.). 

Phage DNA, which iss double stranded is injected into the bacterial cell, once in the cell it circularises, and integraes into the baaacterial chromosome, and is then copied along with it in binary fision. stimuli such as UV light can cause the phage to be cut out of the DNA and it enters the lytic cycle. Some of the host DNA can be taken with the cut out phage. (removing a gene may be an advantage?). the phage finds a new bacterium and inserts into its DNA, which can lead to the Introduction of a new gene. 

> NOTE: There will be many insstance where not  full gene iss cut, or too much is cut so cannot fit into the pahge capsid, but evolution will favour the survivor. 

## Practical
Both bacteria and phage replicate in solution, at some point a plateu will be reached. solution will be plated those that burt (ffrom phage ) will not grow, unifecte will grow. plaques/ clear areas on the bacterial lawn, can be seen and counted. (obviously the correct dilution is required). 

### Bacterial one step gorwn th curve. used to measure burst side, (ie how mny phage particles are released when the bacterium bursts, this is normally between 50-400 depending on phage species bacterial species and bacterial cell size). 

First the bacterium is mixed with the bacterium, then a sserie of dilutions is done, nad samples are removed at specific intervals. normaally between 6--80 minutes for T4 phage. The bacterium are syncrinised by chlorforming them to release all the phage, at a certain dilution phage will not longer be able to find new bacterium. 

after adding the phage their is an ecipse period in which all of the bacteriaal cell machinaray iss performing transcription and translation of the viral genome (about 20 minutes). the bcteriophage then tarts to assemble, and burt the bacterium. the number of plake forming units i sthe number of lysing bacteria, the number of bursting bacteria increases as the phage spreads, until there are no bacteria left only phage, at the start of the experiment. regular chloroforming every bacterium which releases phages is responsible for the formation of one plaque. 

### T4 phages
(Theses are an example of T even phages, ie T=2,4,6). Theses phages are icosohedral, the T4 phage in particular is a double stranded DNA 

#### Consitituents

##### Shealth
covered by glycoproteins. 

##### Tail fibers. 
The composition of these fibers do not is very similar in all T even phages. 

NOTE: As the cell wall of all gram positive are the same bacteriophage bonding is not very specific, the deciding factor is whether the bacteria has the machinary to facilitate phage replication. 

#### Mode of action 
The Phage binds with tail fibres, and the sheath contracts forcing the DNA in, (the whole phage does no enter as the cell wall is too thick). 

## Classification 
Bacteria are not classified on the tree of life, but are still classified into family (written in italics, with a capital and ending in viridae). 

### Viral species. 
A group of viruses sharing the same genetic information and ecological niche (i.e. the host). Common names are used for species, subspecies are designated by a number. 
Do not reproduction, and have no phylogenetic trees (a tree showing evolutionary relationships based on homology of nucleic acids and amino acids). 

Viral species are host specific so are not related to each other. 

NOTE: every living host currently on the planet has a associated virus. 

For example HIV, is a species, there is HIVI and HIVII which both infect humans but are completely different species, within a species there are different strains/subspecies/subtypes within a species,which have amino acid or genomic variation. 

NOTE: viruses cannot be classified by morphology either. Also as they have arisen many times during evolution there is not common ancestor.

For example, _Herpesviridae_ is the family, _Herpesvirus_ is the genus, Human herpes virus (is the species), subtypes HHV-1 HHV-2, HHV-3. 
_Retroviridae_, _Lentivirus_, human immunodeficiency virs, HIVI (lost of subtypes), HIVII (constrained to particular location in west Africa).

HIV is a very fast mutating virus, (variation of about 18\%), different host immune systems will but different evolutionary pressure on the virus to evolve.

The amount of similarity required for viruses to be classified as a different species, depends on the virus itself. 

NOTE: Classification can also be based on pathogenic character. 

### Characteristics used for classification
Viruses are devided into different taxonomic groups based on several features

### Genomics
80\% RNA 20\% DNA. classified by type of nucleic acids RNA/DNA, and doulbe/single stranded. 

#### Double stranded DNA
Tend to be very large. The largest virus is small pox. 

#### Single stranded 
Very small 

#### Single stranded RNA 
There are two types 

#### Megaviruses, gyruses. 
Discovered about 15 years ago, (should they be viruses or a whole new domain, they contain dsDNA, )

#### dsDNA
with a RNA intermediate, copied back to DNA. 
COntain hepatisis virus. 

#### Retroviruses
Single stranded RNA, copies itself into dsDNA using reverse transcriptase, which then integrates into the DNA of the cell, (which makes it very hard to recognise. 

### Host 


### Shape

### Presence of envelope 

### Transcription mechanism in the host

NOTE: dsDNA replicates the same way as in cells. 

There are seven groups, ssDNA, dsDNA, dsRNA, + sense ssRNA, -ve sense RNA ssRNA reverse transcribing virus with DNA intermediates, dsDNA with RNA intermediates. 

NOTE: virus is classified based on the nucleic acid within the virion. 

### Baltimore Classification Scheme
COPY IMAGE. 

NOTE: remember RNA viruses have genes, some can translate directly, some require some form of intermediate. 
NOTE: viruses tend not have introns. 

### Summary 
viruses are composed of portiens nucelic acids and sometimes a lipid envelope, 
there are two basic symetries helical and icosohedral (polyherdal, for larger vieuses)
Viral caposids are mode up of portien subunits or capsomere s which fold to form specific structures. Genomes within viruses capos are lieat or circular RNA/DNA which are folded and interact with the capsid proteins through electronstatic or hydrophobic interactinos. 
Viable virus particles or viruses are infectious.Viruses have multiple origins and co-evolved with their hosts. 
viruses are classified according to the expression (mRNA) of their genes. 
 

## Life cycle. 

### Attachment
The virus has to attach to the host

### Inject DNA

### Transcribe
Make viral proteins important for replication. These proteins interact with the host cell, dirrecting it to replicate the virus, transcribe it and package it. Each protein can have many functions. 

### Replication 

### Late transcription. 

### Packaging 

### Maturation phase

### Exit

#### Lysis 
bursts the host cell open

#### Exocytosis 
bud out of the membrane by exocytosis. 

Some insert into host DNA. 

NOTE prac is on the one step growth curve. 

NOTE: there is a difference between generalised and specialised transduction, 

## Generalised transduction. 
normally beneficial to the bacteria recieving the new bacterial DNA. 

## Culture of viruses. 
because viruses need a living host, a living host is required, this can be a tissue or a cell culture. (cells separated from tissue and placed in a growth medium). 

dedifferentiated cell lines are immortalised, there is an immortalised cell line, hela (henriety lax) cells, taken from ovary tissue. had several children and eveloped the most virulent form of overian cancer ever seen, lead to a debate over who has control over other people cells.

Growing viruses. viruses kept in living cells, which form monolayer. plant cells require removing the cell wall, to form protoplasts, or the cells can be separated with still their cell walls by dissolving the middle lamella. 

normally cows or horses are used, and cells separated by physical and enzymatic treatment, the cells are then placed in the culture medium. 

# Growing viruses in the lab. 

## model systems are often used such as mice, chimps, rabbits, primates. 

NOTE: limitations of a model.

## Isolating phage
The host is required for growth 

macromolecues can be separated by size charge or density. enveloped viruses (and other cellulart  organelles can often be seartated according to their buoyant density (eg viruses with large membranes are lesss dense than those with smaller envelopes proteins or nculeic acid will be much denser. as viruses are less dense  a high speed centrifuge is required, density gradient centrifugation is also used (for example using a gradient of sucrose concentrations).

The virus particles will band/float according to theur respective equilibrium buoyan density, the electron microscope can be used to check the virus is their, long flexible viruses may break up in centrifugation. to get DNA or RNA out oif the capsid use proteases. Gel electrophorsis is used to separate out nucleic acids. 

## Ratezonal centrifugation
form of differential centrifugatrion based on size of particles, which allows for raod fractionation and purification of subcellular particles (e.g. organelles, virions). the largest particels will sediment most rapidly or under the least force, eg in an infected cell organelles mictochondria will sedimant first the viruses then ribosomes, in the case of a very big viruses serpation may come out with microsomal fraction and plasma membrane so density gradient may be required to separate virus. 

Electromicroscopy, stain with a heavy metal, prep grid and bombard with electrons. 

Virus Identification 
when viruses infect the cell a pathology has occured, the symptoms is what is see but the abnormalities of the cells themselves is a cytopathic effect. serological test (proiteins) based on the principal of the specificity of binding of an antibody to specific antigen viral antigen detect antibodies against virusees or virus-infected cells, 

antibodies bind to  specific epitopes of the proteins of the virues, protein capsids are different between different groups of viruses. (antigenic implies interacts with an antibody). ELISA, or used antibodies to identify viruses in neutraliztion test such as viral hemagglutination or complement fixation tests,
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assya ISEM or western plots.ELISA is being replaced by PCR, as it is quicker and more sensitive. 

Nucleic acids 
hybridization (Southern blot) based on the principal that two complementary strands will bind to each other 

based Polymerase chaing reaction (PCR) based on the exponential amplification of DNA by heat stable DNA polymerase. 

western blots and ELISA are the two most common methods used to identify viruses in the lab. 

### Cytopathic effects. 
cells form monolayer joined by connective tissue, once virus is added to the cells the cells round up, whcihc is very common for many viruses. The nucleic also swell. becuase of all the replication processes required. 

Electron mciroscope heavy emtal gives dark stain around the virus, revealing its shape, viruses incubated with specific antibody, ie antibody added to homogenate. heavy die then bonds to AB-virus body forming a thick died complex, the viruses which do not bind must be of a different type, this process is ISEM immunosorbent electron microscopy. 

recently it has become much easier to detect nucleic acid then the protein coat, by PCR, 

### PCR
design primer (18-25 nucleotides annealing temp) homologous to required DNA
Denature DNA 92
anneal primer, (45-60C)  extension 72C, Repeat the 3 cycles about 35 times. 

to differentiate between different strains a nonconserved region must be used however for larger groups conseved regions must ber used for RNA C-DNA synthesis Reverse transcriptase is required, 

NOTE: PCR is not replication but amplification, as it is an exponential process. so in theory only one piece of DNA is required, and in practise still only a small amount of DNA. 



find western blot and ELISA, 

### Southern blot. 
COPY from slide, 
SB is based on the principal of hybridizationi of two complementary homologous DNA strands. ss DNA test fragments are run on a gel, transffered to a nitrocellulose membrane and then incubated in a solution containing the probe (known complementary ssDNA sequencce), labelled with radioactive or flourecent nucleotides) eg Alpha -32P-dCTP 
unbound nucleotides are washed off and if the two strains hybridise they are detected using an autoradiography film, if no hybridisation takes palce then the test sample is not related to the probe.
southern blot is used to detect DNA, (RNA is northern blots). protein run on gel instead of DNA, DNA transfered out of gel onto membrane, specific DNA probes (slightly longer than primers ) are used. the probe is complimentary to a small region of the viral DNA, (so the sequence of the virus must be known). ethidium bromide or ther stain used and flourecent light. the probe is radioactively labelled, (labelled probe is "hot"). visualising binding.

for rpobe to bind viral DNA must be denatured. 
southern blot proceedure, COPY IMAGE, 

DNA run on gel, (sometimes cleave DNA first if large), gel placed above alkaline solution in platform and covered by nitrocellulose membrane, with filter paper above it, the alkaline solution moves up by capillary action passively, or an electrode can be used to speed up the process. Nitrocellulose combined with probe (hybridised.) nitrocellulose then wasted so if probe has nto bound then no bands seen on the autoradiogram.
