# Glycolysis
Glycolysis is the stepwise degradation of glucose

## Background
Glycolysis is a very ancient process, which arose relatively early on in evolutionary history, and as a result today almost all living organisms undergo some form of glycolysis. Glycolysis is also anaerobic, as it arose before oxygen formed a large substituent of the earths atmosphere. In Aerobic organism glycolysis remains anaerobic although the products of glycolysis are fed into the aerobic pathways. 

## Process
Glycolysis involves the break down of 1 glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules, ($6C \rightarrow 3C$), via ten enzymes catalysed steps. 

### Phase #1 (Priming)
Glucose is converted into the right form for energy to be release from it. 
(Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate is produced by the splitting of glucose.)

#### Energy requirements
2 ATP molecules are used in this process. 

### Phase #2
Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate is converted to pyruvate. 

### Reaction #1
Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase or glucokinase, which require magnesium to function). This reaction constitutes the first priming reaction and requires an ATP molecule to proceed. 

#### Equation
$Glucose + ATP \riightarrow glucose-6-phosphare + ADP + H^+$  $\quad \quad $ $\Delta G^\circ  = -16.7 kJ\cdot ml^{-1}$

#### Enzymes
Glucokinase only functions at high glucose levels whereas hexokinase binds glucose at low glucose concentrations,hence glucokinase is only active after a high glucose meal. Extracellular glucose will move into the cell as glucose is converted from glucose to glucose 6 phosphate, by the law of mass action. 

#### Regulation.
Hexoinkase is one of the regulated enzymes in glycolysis (high negative $\Delta G$)

The reaction is not thermodynaically favorable without coupling with ATP. 

### Reaction #2
Phosphoglucoisomerase (Mg catalyses the isomerisation of glucose-6-phosphate). 

### Reaction #3
Second priing reaction requires ATP, phosphofructokinase (Mg) adds a second phosphrylation. 

### Reaction #4
Fructose biphosphate aldose, producs two 3 carbo intermediate. 

### Reaction #5
Triose phosphare isomerase compelets the first phase of glycolysis by catalysing an ismoerisation reaction. 

### Phase 2
### Reaction #6
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase produces a high energy intermediate in an oxidation reaction. 

### reaction #7

#### Spontaneity
Very spontaneous coupling with reaction six, drives reaction six

#### Reaction
$1,3-BPG+ADP \rightarrow 3 phosphoglycerate+ATP$ $\Delta G^\circ ' -18.9kJ.mol^{-1}$ 

#### Enzyme
Phosphoglycerate Kinase

#### Cofactors
#### ATP Production
regenerates ATP used earlier in Glycolysis. 

Phosphoglycerate kinase ($Mg^{2+}$) as in the back reaction the phosphoglycerate is phosphorylated. or it could be called 1,3-Bisphosphate phosphatase. 

this reaction has a large negative $\Delta G$ and hence is a site of regulation. 

first substrate level phosphrylation occurs, ie the phosphate group derrives dirrectly from the phosphate, in the ETC ATP is formed from ATP by substrate level phosphorylation. 



Break even reaction, energy lost is equal to energy gained


Reaction #7 

$1,3-BPG+ADP \rightarrow 3 phosphoglycerate+ATP$ $\Delta G^\circ '$ -18.9kJ.mol^{-1}. 
Phosphoglycerate kinase ($MG^{2+}$) as in the back reaction the phosphoglycerate is phosphorylated. or it could be called 1,3-Bisphosphate phosphatase. 

this reaction has a large negative $\Delta G$ and hence is a site of regulation. 

first substrate level phosphrylation occurs, ie the phosphate group derrives dirrectly from the phosphate, in the ETC ATP is formed from ATP by substrate level phosphorylation. 



Break even reaction, energy lost is equal to energy gained

### Reaction #8

#### Phosphoglycerate mutase (mutases move only one functional group). this reaction prepares the substrate for the following reaction involving the synthesis of ATP, ie priming the phosphate group for removal.
### Reaction #9

#### Enzyme
Enolase. 

#### Reaction
Dehydration reaction 

$2 phosphoglycerate \rightarrow phosphoenolpyruvate$

As much more instable in the enol form so it is a muich higher energy molecule (it has not gained energy, only instability). 
enols tautomerise to ketones.

produces PEP via dehydrogenase (?)



### Reaction #10

#### Enzyme
pyruvate kinase (phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase)

transfer of a phosphoryl group from PEP to ADP to generate ATP and Pyruvate, enol tautomer converted to more favourable keto tautomer, 

tautomers are isomers which can readily intraconvert between each other. 

#### Reaction

$Phosphoenolpyruvate \rightarrow pyruvate$
pyruvate Kinase produces pyruvate and mro ATP 

### Kinase enzymes.
transfer a phosphate group. 

### phosphatase
a dephosphorylating enzyme. 




## Biological significance
Glycolysis is a particularly important process as in many cases glucose is the only source of metabolic energy. Cells of the brain kidney contractual skeletal muscles, erythrocytes, and sperm cell, are all solely reliant on glycolysis for energy. 

## Products
Pyruvate is a versatile metabolite, depending on the availability of oxygen, pyruvate can undergo further oxidation to form acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide. If oxygen is not present then in animal cells the pyruvate will be converted to lactic acid (lactate), and in yeast cells it will undergo alcoholic fermentation to form ethanol.
