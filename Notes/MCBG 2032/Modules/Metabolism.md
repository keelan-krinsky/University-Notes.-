# Metabolism 
 
## Background  
Metabolism is the sum of chemical changes which convert nutrients into energy and products via specific chemical intermediates. Metabolism is organised into a number of discrete pathways, and governed by a relatively small set of relatively simple rules. 

### __Kinetics: Kinetics__

## Metabolic Pathways 
Many important metabolic pathways are ancient, originating billions of years ago. For example glycolysis evolved as an anaerobic process because it is so old that it originated when there was still very low atmospheric oxygen concentration. These ancient pathways make up a basic set of metabolic pathways common to almost all organisms. Metabolic variation between organisms and higher taxa relates more often to differences in the regulation, or number and identity of intermediates of theses core pathways, and not from the development of entirely new pathways. Different cells and organisms may express alternative pathways, diversity to metabolic processes. Metabolic variation may also result from differences in expression in different organisms or cells.

the process of metabolsim involves the genration of energy and the synthesis of biomolecules

### __CoenzymeCycles: Coenzyme Cycles__

###__Glycolysis: Glycolysis__


## Regulation

### Separation
catabolsim and metabolism cannot be left to occur at the same time without tight control. metabolic needs are served in an immediate and orderly fashion. competing metabolic pathways localised in different cellular compartments, to avoid any interferance. (copy example). 
The intermediates are spacially and chemcically segrigated. the competing pathways are isolated from eachother. 

### Regulation Points
A pathway cannot go backways and forways, for one becasue the would be no way of regulating it, the points of regulation are the points at which the eqillirium is shifted very strongly in one dirrection
