# Coenzyme Cycles
(oxidative reactions release hydride ions $H^-$) which is how electrons are transferred. the hydride ions are tranferred to the oxidised form of the coenzymes to reduce them $NAD^+\rightarrow NADH$. NADH is oxidised to AND^+ during anabolsim and finally the electon acceptro oxygen which when it is reduced becomes water. 
the additional H adds to the nictotinamine portion of the molecule. 

### NAD(P)H cycle.
