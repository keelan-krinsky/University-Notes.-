# Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

Glucose has a lot of potential energy 
the energy produced by glycolysis is onyl a small fraction of that energy
a little more is released in the citric acid cycle, most energy is released in oxidative phosphrylation. 

## Step 1
$pyruvate \righatarrow acetyl-CoA\rightarrow CO_2$ (oxidation  via TGA (citric acid cycle)). Electrons released  and DADH and FADH_2 produced. and the $O_2$, e;ectron treansfer 
energy stored inthe gra

30-38 molecules of ATP generated per glucose 2 fromglycolysis 2 fromTCA, 24 electrons removed in compllete oxidation ofg glucose. t
