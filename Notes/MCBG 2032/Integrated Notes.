## Interactions between genes/ Alleles
### Incomplete dominance
#### Genetic/ molecular cause
The recessive allele does not produce any functioning protein.
The dominant allele does function protein but not in high enough quantities to
result in the same phenotypic effect as a heterozygous dominant

#### phenotypic effect
A heterozygous individual will display a phenotype intermediate to that of
homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive
### Dominance
#### Genetic/molecular cause
The recessive allele does not produce any functioning protein.
The dominant allele does function protein, which it produces in comparative
amount to a homozygous dominant individual
#### Phenotypic consequence.
the heterozygous phenotype is identical to that of the heterozygous dominant
individual.
### Co-dominance
#### Genetic/ molecular cause
Both alleles are transcribed/translated to form a functioning protein
#### phenotypic effect
The effect comes from the full expression of both alleles
### Dominance hierarchies.
It is often the case that there will be a number of alleles for one gene. In
which case a dominance hierarchy is usually present such that allele A is
Dominant to B is dominant to C and so forth (ie dominance in a hierarchy is
 transitive)
### pleiotropy (Check spelling)
Genetic/molecular cause
One gene locus affects the expression of several characteristics.
Phenotypic cause
Phenotype of one characteristic will change in conjunction with the phenotype of
another characteristic
### Notes about colour
As many genetic examples are based on colour it is worth understanding the basics
of colouring in animals.
colour results from pigments which are proteins, individual genes can either code
directly for the production of these proteins or as an intermediate/enzyme
which aids in the production of these proteins.
#### White
white does not result from a specific pigment but rather from a lack of pigment.
#### Co-dominance and Incomplete dominance
a co-dominant colour combination can look like an intermediate if it is the
combination of two pigments, however in the case where one of the phenotypes is
white then a intermediate can only be a result of incomplete dominance
### Important examples
#### Frog colour
##### details
the skin colour of a certain from is controlled by one allele. There are three
different phenotypes observed, these are red, blue, and purple.
##### explanation
This is an example of co-dominance as the purple colour comes from a combination
of the red and blue pigments. that is both red and blue pigments have been
produced. We can conclude that the purple from is heterozygous, the blue frog
is homozygous blue and the red frog is homozygous red.

#### Fruit flies eye colour.
##### details.
the colour of fruit flies eyes is determined by two gene loci. a fly with
dominant alleles at the red locus will be red eyed, while a fly with dominant
 alleles at the brown locus will be brown eyed. However a fly with both
dominant brown and cinnabar will be white eyed.
##### explanation
the white eyed phenotype is due to a form of inhibition similar to epistasis
stops either of the pigments form being produced if both pigment genes are
present.

#### Rabbit Skin Colour
##### details
the skin colour of rabbits is determined by one gene locus, which has four
possible Alleles.
All alleles code for the enzyme tyrosinase which acts to convert tyrosine into
dopamine a critical first set in the production of hair pigment.
###### #1 non functional
The most recessive Allele codes for a nonfunctioning version of tyrosinase
leading to albino rabbit.
###### #2 heat sensitive
The next most recessive allele codes for a heat inactivated version of tyrosine
meaning that the final colour of the rabbits fur will depend on the temperature
conditions it was raised in, and also that within a certain temperature range
there will be a distinct colour difference between the warmer and colder parts
of the animal.
###### #3 localised functionality
The next most recessive allele codes for a version of tyrosinase does not fold
quite "correctly" and as such does not glycosalate in the same way as the
dominant version. melanocytes which produce the grey pigment will still accept
this tyrosinase into their cytoplasm and as such grey pigment will be produced.
however as intracellular transport is affected the tyrosinase either cannot
reach or cannot enter melanocytes capable of producing the brown pigments and so
they rabbits are full grey
###### #4 fully functional
the most dominant allele codes for a fully functional form of tyrosinase and
the combination of grey and orange pigments produced gives the rabbits a full
brown coat.

#### human Blood types.
#### details
human blood types are determined by one gene locus with three alleles.
allele O is recessive, and codes for no functioning protein.
allele A and B are co dominant and each code for different sugars which are
attached to the outside of red blood cells.






#### Bombay phenotype
##### details
parents A and AB, child O, mates with A, results B, AB and O.
##### explanation
A and B sugars are attached to red blood cells by appending them onto the end
of glycoproteins called Substance H which are already attached to the cell.
If a individual is homozygous recessive for substance H genes, none will be
produced and so even if the have A or B alleles they will have a functionally
O phenotype.

###Alleles and genes
A gene is a collection/ group of alleles which could occur the same locus and
which are associated with the same traits.

###lethal alleles
alleles which are incompatible with the organisms continued survival
#### dominance
most lethal alleles are recessive because dominant lethal alleles produce non
functioning proteins only so any individual with even one of the dominant allele
would be unlikely to survive to reproductive age, and so the Allele would very
quickly be bread out of the population.
#### sex chromosomes
 lethal alleles, or alleles linked with low fertility located on the Y
chromosome in humans are very rare.
disease related to homozygous XX are more likely to be suffered by woman, as
they will have one working copy of the given gene so they can survive but
one defective copy which leads to the illness. males on the other hand will
either survive and be entirely healthy with a working copy or die, if they are
even born if they have only a defective copy.




##### lethal dominants
lethal dominants may occur in one of two cases. First, if the onset of the
disease/ defect related to the Allele only occurs after reproductive age.
Secondly if a De Novo (random, once off) DNA mutation occurs in a given
individual.
lethal dominants can also result from an Allele which interferes with the  
formation of aggregates of the protein which the gene codes for, or receptors of
that protein,or finally if it has a detrimental effect on another protein or
gene (such as the yellow mice)

#### examples

##### Yellow Mice.
##### details
Y allele codes for the yellow coloured pigment.
y codes for other pigment/no pigment.
Y is a lethal Dominant(?) Allele. As a YY individual with not develop bast
the early stages of implantation into the uterine wall.
##### molecular/genetic explanation
When the Y allele is present at the gene loci it causes a deletion in which,
its own gene promoter, as well as the coding sequence of the gene upstream
of it(the MERC gene necessary in RNA processing) are removed. the net result
 being that proteins relating to the gene upstream are no longer removed, and
 the pigment gene is now promoter by the MERC promoter instead of its own
promoter
##### Result and Phenotype
the result is that Yy individual still produce enough RNA processing proteins to
survive/ avoid miscarriage,but they are more susceptible to diseases such as obesity
and cancer. Also their yellow pigment gene is promoted heavily during early
development leading to yellow coloured fur.
YY miscarriages early in pregnancy as it cant produce necessary RNA processing
proteins.
yy is health individual without yellow colour.
birth rations will be skewed by the fact that YY individuals are not actually
born.
NOTE: this is an example of incomplete dominance of Y with respect to MERC.
