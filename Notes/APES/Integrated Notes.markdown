# Definitions

##### Emergent properties
Properties which can only be observed at the correct scale as the result from interactions between parts which are not apparent when viewing those parts in isolation
###### Example
1. Climate is a emergent property of weather
2. Clouds are an emergent property of water vapour particles in the atmosphere

##### Bifurcations
Small random changes in a system which can lead to large changes in the direction the system takes and the ultimate stable state which the system settles at.

##### Genet
Organisms (of the same species) with distinct genetic make up.

##### Ramet
Organisms which have an identical genotype but which are none-the-less modular/ meaningfully separate physically of morphologically

### Basis theories
thoeries from which the begining of ecology and more broadly the scientific method arose.

#### Reductionism
Describing or analysing complex phenomenon in terms of phenomena held to represent a simpler or more fundamental level, which if fully understood can provide a complete explanation/prediction for the complex phenomenon

#### Holism
The theory/position that the hole can be more than simply the some of the parts due to the interactions between the parts which lead to emergent properties. (emergent properties can only be observed at the right scale)

#### Mathusianism
Organisms don't grow independently they are constrained by energy and material requirements which leads to regulatory feedback
(Associated with thomas malthusian)

#### Classical economics
There are not limits to growth because human ingenuity will always outpace human expansion.
(Associated with Ester boserup)

#### Entities Higher than the organism

##### Basic Questions
* Can conscious entities greater than the organism exist.
* Can natural selection take place at entities above the organism level.

## Applications of Ecology
Determining carrying capacity
How much can be harvested from stock without upsetting cultivation environment
solving existential crisis,such as problem related to limits to growth.

## Systems

### Not systems

#### Case #1
Single object with inputs and outputs

#### Case #2
Multiple objects which interact linearly with each other, (i.e there is no circular causality)

NOTE:The interactions of one object with another could just be thought of as a input to the object in question and it could be analysed in isolation.

### (chaotic) systems
2 or more objects which interact with each other, this implies circular causality and non linear models must be used, and bifurcations often result

#### Complex systems
Complex system are not necessarily complicated in the conventional sense of the word, but they are very hard to predict.

##### Characteristics

###### Multiple stable states
It is very hard to predict how to shift between stable states, or what parameters variables must remain within to sustain a given stable state these boundary value are sometime known as thresholds or sepratrics, changes below a threshold cause little to no change in the system, changes above a threshold can cause rapid and dramatic changes resulting in a flip to another stable state.

###### Multiple factor causes

###### Circular causality

###### Emergent properties

###### Nestedness

###### Feedback loops (positive and negative)

###### Non-linear relationships

NOTE: within a complex system it is reasonable to suspect many surprises. Especially if you happen to be a human endoured with all of the primative problem solving techniques which humans are best at.

##### Wicked problems
multiple complex systems all interacting

##### Super wicked problems
1. Time limits
2. No Centeral authority
3. The adjent responsible for fixing the problem is infact part of the problem
4. future irrationality

### Models
1. aid in understanding
2. simplification of reality
3. systems change over time

#### Population models

##### expanential growth.
Insert graph

###### Examples
1. Elephants in the Kruger Park
2. Bacterial infections in humans

##### Exponential decay.
Often used when half lives are important.

##### Exponential Approaches
Decays to some lower (non zero) constant value

###### Examples
Acid mine drainage:

  Because some acidity is sequestered in the beds of rivers and streams even when the source is removed there will still be a reserve of acid to enter the water, so it will be very hard to reduce acid concentrations completely back to their ideal (zero) state.

##### S/ Sigma Shaped

###### Examples  
Ther growth of a population with a definate carrying capacity

##### Overshoot
The system does not settle at a high eqillibrium.

###### Examples
1. Delays responce to limiting factors.
2. damage to common resources.

##### Ocillations
Cycles in a sustained manner. Generally occur because of lags (delay responce to stimuli)

###### Examples
1. heart rythms
2. preditor pre ocillations.

NOTE: amplitude of the ocillation can change

# Organsim level Ecology

## defining environments.
environments are a smooth continuum of suitable (good) to unsuitable (bad). There is a threshold below which conditions are too ad to sustain a particular organism, below this line there are no available habitats. above this  line there is spectrum of habitats varying from poor to good, with associated increase in survival and reproductive rates.
##### Examples
Elephants in the Kruger

 because of artificial water easy for herds with young elephants to move around which otherwise they would be unable to migrate.
artificial water sources. this artificially increased the carrying capacity.


## What is an Individual
Especially in the case of rametes exaclty what cxonstitues one individual, and what constitues a group of individuals can be unclear.

### Unitary

#### Determinate forms
1. the size and shape will vary predictable, and life cycle stages will progress steadily and ordinally.

### Modular
1. the form, growth and life cycle state of an organism is unpredictable.
2. modular organism are composed of many modules/ sub units. (which often display phenotypic plasticity)


## Life Cycles

### Mammals
1. juvaniles
2. subadults (?)
3. adults
4. senescents

### Trees
1. seeds
2. seedlings
3. saplings
4. adult trees

### Insects
1. Eggs
2. larvae
3. Papa
4. instars
5. adults

NOTE: migration, survival , reporiduction and other rates vary dependant on life cycle stages.

## Reproduction

### Reproductive Rate  
combination of many factors.
1. length of reproductive season.
2. (reproduced output ) number of offspring produced.
3. Investment
4. generation length (time between birth of mother and birth of daughter)
5. age of maturity.

#### potential population rate of change.
how fast populations can change. $r_{m} ~or~ r$ are common symbols for the maximum growth rate.

### K selecting
adaptions which favour ability to survive over the ability to reproduce. well adapted to predictable, crowded environments with significant resource scarcity.

#### general traits
1. large
2. can deffer reproduction to a later time.
3. iteroparous.
4. high investment per offspring
5. body resources invested more into survival than reproduction.

### R selecting
unpredictable environments, periods/ areas of sudden abundance.

#### general traits
1. small(er)
2. earlier maturity
3. invest in reproduction versus survival
4. many offspring but with low investment per offspring.

#### Variation in abundance over time.
1. patchy resource allocation
2. inter-species interactions (predation, symbiosis)
3. environment
4. social structure

##### resources.
physicochemical.
conditions.  
1. temperature
2. humidity
3. occupancy.


### Reproductive cycles.

#### Annuals
Annual organism grow mature reproduce and die off, within a year.

Copy Graph

#### Iteroparous
Organsims which can reproduce repeatedly/ continuously over their lifetimes

##### Seasonal
Long lived organisms which breed seasonally (eg Kudu or impala )

##### Continuous
Relatively long lived individuals.

##### Semelparous
Similar life cycle to annuals but with a much longer juvanile period. (eg Salmon and centuary plant)

#### Sex
Individuals differ by sex.

NOTE: In mammals it is often the young males who must migrate from the place that they are born before they breed.

## Survival

2. marmites.

#### Type 3

##### Typical populations
large mammals.

# Population level Ecology
The basic definition of a population is a group of individuals living in the same place, at the same time, who can interbreed.

NOTE: this basic definition runs into a number of problems, Most commonly different species which can interbreed and populations which seem to be geographically separated but actually interact in important and predictable ways.

##### Functioning definition
A  group of individuals for which it is meaningful to discuss:
1. birth rate death rate and abundance estimates.
2. Administrative boundaries
3. estimation approaches
4. population characteristics
5. compostion
6. favourable and non favourable environments,
## Plant herbivore systems
Obtaining nutrition from plants in very difficult due to their high fibre content.Fibre is a slow and (energy) expensive material to break down.
### Herbivours.

#### Strategies

##### Behavioural adaptations

1. Actively seeking out the best food from a poor pool of available food sources.
2. making use of nutritous foods when they are availabe, for example eating seasonally.

###### late wet season
 Focus on preferred foods, eating selectively in an attempt to grow body size and build up fat resereves.
 NOTE: at this point the herbivour has a narrow niche breadth

###### early dry season
Consume less preferred, but more readily availabe foods in an attempt to maintain body mass/fat reserves

###### late dry season
Begin to eat non/less selectively, consuming avoided/unpalatable foods (such as evergreens )

NOTE: At this point the herbivore is undergoing a degree of nutritional stress and has a wide niche breadth.


#### Morphological adaptations

Symbiosis between herbivores and microbes (even in animals such as termites)

##### Rumen (ruminants )

###### Structure
Rumen is a four chambered stomach

Insert image.

###### process
1. silica and food is rolled into a bolus in the back of the mouth and swallowed dow the oesophagus
2. at the end of the oesophagus the reticulum sorts fibre into the rumen and nutritious food directly into the omasum.

NOTE: some microbes are also digested so the stomach is in effect acting as some form of microbe farm.


###### Functionality
Better use of higher quality foods
cannot digest poor quality foods well
digestion of fibre is too slow to support the animal.
have the advantage in the wet season.

###### Examples
cows, and buffalo

##### Ceacalid digestion (cecum )

###### Structure
ceacum, blind ended sack as large intestine joins colon, responsible for digesting fibre.


###### Caecalids
wide tolerance for plant quality
cannot gain as much nutrition from high quality foods
advantage in the dry season (niche differentiation)


###### Examples
horse, zebra, elephants, lagomorphs (eg rabbits etc)
insert image.

NOTE: the ceacum and the rumen both make use of fermentation.


#### Forage categories

##### Quality
Nutrituous food not commonly abundant throught the year.

##### Staple
Relatively large amounts of the plant are available, and the plant is relatively nutritious and palatable

##### Restricted intake
There is normally a severe shortage of these foods but the herbivore has a high preference for them (they are often highly nutritious)

##### Reserve
It is possible to live/sustain for long periods on reserve foods, however it is less nutritous and less pallatable.

##### Buffer
Extremely unpallatable, only eaten when there is no other food available.


NOTE: Herbivores prefer quality or staple foods which contain more nutrients to reserves of buffer foods. however they only consume high quantities of these food in the wet and early dry season under normal circumstances, as there are not freely accesible throughout the year,

### Plants perspective

#### Defence mechanisms / grazing resistance.
All strategies which deal with herbivore disturbance.

###### Defence
A defence is effective if it is a feature of an organism which increases the energy spent by a consumer in locating and handling that organism (as a result the consumer will eat less of it.)

##### Tolerance
strategies focused around increased growth to make up for biomas lost in browsing/grazing

##### Avoidance
Strategies focus around reducing the amount of grazing which takes place.

###### Morphological characteristics

1. Spines,thorn prickles,
2. Shell (for seeds or nuts)
3. Cellulose and or lignin incorporated into the plant structure

###### Biochemical
Tannins/ Toxins.

QUALITATIVE:
Toxins capable of causing severe physiological distress in the the animals whin ingest them.(For example HCN)
these compounds are very expensive to produce and so normally only small plants which do not grow fast (so need to conserve all of their accumulated biomass) tend to produce these toxins.These toxins as a generally rule are either present in sufficiently high concentrations to provide severe discouragement/damage to potential herbivores, or they are entirely absent.

QUANTITATIVE:
Detergents, (for example tannins. All tannins are compounds which bind to proteins making them harder to digest.)
Quantity/concentration of deterant can vary,


## Herbivor- carnivor relationships

### prey
NOTE: Animals can run away

#### Nutritional quality
plants 40C:1N
Animals 10C: N
the lower carbon to nitrogen ration makes animals more appealing/ nutrient dense food.

### Preditors

#### Searching prediters (Coursing)
These preditors will seek out and run down their prey, sometimes over long ditances. Usually they will test out a prey herd several times to identify the most favourable prey items before making their attack

#### Sit and wait predator (Ambush)
have a particular kill zone, any potential prey item entering this kill zine is at risk of being attacked/consumed.   

##### Examples
Most cats, carnivorous plants, spiders.

#### Strategies.

##### Generalist strategy/ polyphagous
Generalsit eat lots of different things although they may have a preference for a particular prey type. They have a short handling time, killing and eating quickly, and a relatively long search time. furthermore, they cannot easily begin a new search while still handling the current prey item.

NOTE: Intake is maximize by eating whatever is found (within broad limits)

###### Examples
  Black back jackals
  Insectivorous birds

##### Specialists (Monophagous )
handling time is long compared to food search times. Specilasits focus on food types that can be attained most efficiently.
Preditors also often live within the site of prey, but because attack and handling is energy expensive and may be dangerous, they focus on the most profitable prey items (sick , injured, naive.)

 NOTE: Intake is maximized by specializing on a particle prey type

##### Role of the environment

Broad diets are favoured in low productivity environments while specialist diets are favoured in highly productive environments.

### Impact on prey populations

#### Additive effect
decease in population density/abundance) becuase Predation adds to other sources of mortality

#### Compensatory effect
Different sources of mortality trade off/ compensate each other for example an animal will either die from disease, starvation or predation, in any eventuallity the animal will die and there will only be one death.

### Host parasite

#### macro parasite
Tapeworm

#### microparasite
 virus bacteria, protist

#### transmission
often transmission is an passive process on the part of the parasite
The average number of newly infected hosts which would arise from a single infected host in a population od susceptible hosts $R_0$.

##### Basic number/ rate of an infection. 

$R_0>1 \rightarrow$ the infectious disease spreads.
$R_0 <1 \rightarrow$ infectious disease recedes.
$R_{0}=1$ = transmission threshold. (must be crossed for a disease to spread,)

##### Factors affecting $R_{0}$
1. S- the number of susceptible hosts.
2. L the time period over which a host is infectious
3. $Beta$ the transmission rate or probabilityi

###### Threshold population size
population size above which a disease is likely to spread through the population  
$S_{T}=\frac{1}{\Beta L}$

### Exams
In exams questions will be very broad requiring one to pick a stance and make a convincing case for it.

### Test
Tests will have shorter more direct questions

### Organisms and their environment.

###### definition: autecology
the view of an organism looking outwards on an environment.

#### requirements of an organism

![General](Images/OrganismNeeds.jpg)


##### response to a given factor.
In general the response on and organism to increasing amounts/concnetrations
of any given factor shows  humped shape growth curve. this growth curve can be
split into several sections.

###### sub critical
bellow the minimum level of the factor which the organism needs to survive.

###### sub optimal
the organism can survive but is not yet operating optimally due to a shortage
of the factor.

###### optimal
the organism has exactly the most beneficial amount of the factor and all other
things being equal, is growing at the highest possible rate.

###### supra optimal
 the organism is growing at below optimal rate because it has a detrimental
 excess of the factor.

##### nutrient requirements

###### plants

###### animals
NOTE: animals can gain water from metabolism.

##### water needs

###### plants
Essential:

    Non-mineral O, C, H
    Macro N, S, Ca, P, K, Mg
    Micro Cl, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn

Beneficial:

    Si, Na, Co, Se

###### Animals

Essential:

    Bulk O,C,H,N,S
    Macro Ca, P, K, Cl, Na, Mg
    Trace Fe, Zn, Cu, I, Mo, Co, Se

Beneficial

    Sn, Ni, Va, F

NOTE: Animals like salt so much, because plants (which don't really need it) don't store in it in large quantities, therefore animals must find mineral sources of salt to augment their plant diets.

###### water availability
97% of water is salt water
of the remaining 3%, 70% is frozen, 29% is underground and 1% remains in rivers
and lakes.

Plants (from saturated to dry)
1. Aquatic
2. Emergent macrophytes
3. Mesophytes
4. Xerophytes

Animals
1. Aquatic
2. Amphibious
3. Land-dwelling Water-dependent.
4. water independent.







#### LieBigs law of the minimum
growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources but by the amount
of the scarcest resource necessary for growth.

##### example: redfield ration
biological entities/system show a very precise and constant element ratio or C:N:P:

    126:16:1 in marine plankton
    100:10:1 in Soil
    100:5:1 in Leaves
    19:3:1 Vertebrates

An increase in any element above that ratio will lead to no additional growth.

#### temperature requirements

![Responce to temperature range](Images/ThermalStimulus.jpg)


##### plants
25 for C3 plants
28-30 for C4, tropical plants.
 ##### Earth as an environment.
 Earth lies in the goldilocks zone with regard to temperature, (and a number of)
 other conditions, not because of its location but more because it has an
 atmosphere which is capable of maintaining it at a stable temperature suitable
 suitable for life.
 the peculiar conditions found on earth result in part from the way the
 biosphere has acted to shape the climate, mineral distribution etc.

### organisms interactions with each other

## intra specific competition

exploitation / interference competitions
fundamental / realised niche
competitive exclusion principle

### Resources
things which an organism can consume
1) growth , reproduction
2) potential for competition

### conditions
1) physio-chemical ()not consumed of competed for )
eg temperature of humidity.
#### ecological niche
summary of an organisms tolerance (in terms of conditions) and requirements (in terms of resources.)

#### niche differentiation
G K Hutchinson 1941
#### N dimensional hyper volume
sets out the boundaries which delineate where a species can exist, grow and reproduce. (each dimension in the hyper volume represents a particulate environmental variable)
overlapping of niches can lead to antagonistic interactions.

##### interference competition
individuals of new species suffer reduction in survival or growth as a result od exploitation od resources od interference by individuals od another species.
can affect population abundance and distribution.

##### Exploitative competition
 competitors interact only indirectly through their shared resource.

##### interference competition
competitors interacts directly to prevent each other from gaining access to the resources, territorial/ antagonistic behaviour
often seen in large carnivorous.

#### theoretical vs practical
the coexistence of seemingly similar species is often explainable by subtle difference is the niches of the two species.

##### examples
in the savanna herbivorous may differentiate their niches,
1. by the relative percentage of the three basic plant type available  which they eat (herbs, grasses, brouse)
2. Herbivorous could then be further differentiated into the relative abundance of the parts of the plant which they eat most (stem, leaves, sheath.) so at a fine enough scale there is seldom direct competition.

#### realised niche ,a species may be excluded from one area which they otherwise would have been able to inhabit as a result of competition
