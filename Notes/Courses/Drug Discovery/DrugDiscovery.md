## New Notes

Drug discovery 

## background 
The development process is difficult, time consuming and expensive, project teams key functional unit, looking fro individuals desiring team success. 
About 15 years of work, with 1billion dollars of investment. Only pharmaceutical companies have the resources for the development. Academics are limited to the discovery part. 

discovery very roughly takes 2-4 years, the preclinical takes 1-2 years, (i.e mouse studies etc). Then clinical trials (run on humans) 4-6 years. 
then comes to market, but still post marketing, where the drug is monitored for several years, and some drugs are pulled off the market due to side effects no observed in clinical trials. A given drug can fail at any point in the process, and especially if it fails late then huge amounts of money is wasted. 

75\%, 50\% cancer 38\% of psychiatric, do not respond to currently available drugs. The drug documentation about 14,000 pages is submitted to the FDA, for approval. 

To start the development of a drug the process starts with a disease. 

### Identifying disease
if the disease has two few patients then the drug will not interest the pharmaceutical agency. There are therefore many neglected diseases, due to economic reasons. 

### target identification
Within the disease a biological target must be identified which the drug can act on. 

### Target validation 
how to see if target is correct. Sometimes shut down in clinical trial three waste 800,000 dollars. 


>NOTE: The complexity of the biological problem plays a part here which is part of what makes cancer drugs so difficult. 

There are many different screening methods used in targeting. 

### Drug molecule
many drug molecules are tested, the lead molecule (which is binding/acting the best) then goes for lead optimisation, in which the molecule is taken and slight analogues of it are made which may be more effective. 

### Animal testing
very daunting process

Breast cancer mouse testing, no real treatment with poor survival rate, injected cell into mice, no tumor in first four weeks, within a weak tumor golf ball sized. Once tumor grows it is terminal stage so drugs not very effective. (stage 4 of cancer no drugs effective). Very complex process often multiple animal models are used. 

#### Scale up 
over 50\% of drugs are natural products. Any process involved in drug discovery is not easy. 

### Investigation of new drug application 	
application at FDA, to run trials, after trials run paperwork submitted reviewed and approval occurs. 

### Professionals involved 

 #. Chemists
 	#. medicinal , synthetic, analytical , computational 
#. biochemists
#. biologists
#. pharmacologists
#. pharmaceutical scientists
	#. Formulation

### Chinese traditional medicine 
Commercialisation of plant extracts used for supplements treatments etc. Even at wits there is an attempt to establish a traditional medicines unit. Funding potentially from Chinese traditional medicine pharmacy. Can be supplement as well as drugs. Must apply for approvals. 

### patents
developer, ie university takes out patent, then pharma buys it, originally it was all in pharma but still taking research from university. big drug 14billion a year, 

## South African situation 
pharmaceuticals do not do their research in south Africa no research no trailing of youth no benefit. However they do run their chemical trails. Much cheaper, less legislation, easier to find desperate people. The price of the final drug is so high that people in third world countries will never be able to afford it.

## Background
lives saved by drug discovery process over the decades, but over targeted investments the course of targeted investment has changed over the last 30 years. Processes can be speed up if there is an urgency seen, so 40 years development 2 day FDA approval. 

Chemotherapeutic drugs
natural products and their derivative: 

taxol, pacelitaxel), velban (Vinblastine, Adriamycin (Doxorubicin)

Small molecules 

5 year survival rate for cancer breast-91, prostate 43-99 and melanoma 49-93. 

reconsisnce of cancer, is cancer aggressive

Domoxifin, gold standard for breast cancer, given to patients for 5-10 years, to prevent regression and prevent transition between breasts. After 2 years 50\% of patients stop responding to the drug, that is they develop drug resistance (the cancer). The second side effect is the development of endometrium cancer. As a result of resistance there is a constant need for the development of new drugs. 

>NOTE: For a gold standard this drug does not perform very well, many side effects. 

Recently case in US doctor running fertility clinic, doctor used own sperm to fertilise rather that fathers. 

### Differnt types of drugs used. 
COPY slide. 

### Cardiovascular. 
diurectics ()	


#### Satins 
cholesterol loading drug, harmless drugs in a sense so doctors are tempted to over prescribe. There is no 'good' or 'bad' cholesterol 2 years ago American association for dietary requirements changed to say cholesterol is not a component of concern in diet. (doctors will not rely information)
80-90\% of cholesterol is made within the body. And in fact the 15\% taken from diet is not taken directly into the blood stream anyway. 

### Alzheimer's 
Identified in 1906. 

many targets but also many failed attempts to develop drugs. 

## Antibiotics
In 1980s and 1990s resistant form of staphlococcus erus 
COPY SLIDE

introduced in 1959 

Even TB 

big pharmas 4 out of the 8 have shut down their antibiotic research facilities completely only Merck, Roche, alxoSmithKline and Pfizer are still active. 

drug resistance will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, actual rate could be much high, as microorganisms Spread. 2 years ago in the UN the industries pledged to develop more antibiotics. Since 2000 only 12 antibiotics have been developed in the last 20 years. This is especially a problem is south Africa as there are a lot of infections. 


>NOTE: South Africa is quite unique in not having any R and D development in South Africa, the most they will ever do is synthesize drugs. Vice-chancellors initiative to establish a center in traditional medicine, trying to bring Aspen on board. Even synthetic chemists have no drug industry work. 

## Case study in India 
patent cancelled in India and research units moved out of the country moved to UK, a stand was taken. 

COPY OVERVIEW IMAGE.

## Discovery process
three phases, target identification.discovery,lead discovery, lead optimisation, preclinical (at least 2 animal models). Registration with FDA. 

## Development 

## New Notes
1.75 billion dollar 15 years on average to develop a drug. 

Major trials are I, II, and III

### Trial I
Very few individuals, low dose of drug, closely observed over a long time. 
If no negative side effects new small group (20 people), continues until maximum tolerable does is found, i.e. maximum does with no side-effects. 

### Phase II

#### A
Therapeutic dose should be as low as possible. Always want minimum dose while maintaining efficacy of the dose. 

#### B
overall efficacy, can vary person to person. How drug is actually acting in reducing the symptoms of the diease. 

#### phase III
Phase three up to thousand individuals, pass rate only about 34\%. (only 34\% get to this point?). 
Complete monitor of cognitive function, motor function metabolic function etc. 

Can be submitted to FDA, if FDA approve the drug then the drug comes to market

#### Phase IV
monitoring of the drug. Try to identify the toxic effects of the drug. And as biologically people differ effects not seen in 1000 individuals may easily manifest at a larger sample size. If there are critical side effects, then drug is immediately recalled from the market. A lot of investment has occurred at this point for example new diabetes drug to inhibit SGL2. Patients encountered a lot of genital infections so bad that, 1\% died, some required plastic surgery, there were only 12 cases, (although potentially there could be many more). Repurposing and repositioning of drugs, for example from cholesterol control to cancer, or for skin infection. Test drugs for multiple diseases off the bat. 

### Failure
Why does it occur. The biology of the disease is the problem for example in SGLD2, must identify everything that the target molecule is actually used for in the molecule. Bigger pharmas need to push drugs through, so may jump to biological target without identifying it properly. Plumbagin, very good anticancer, but also very toxic. 

### Target selection 

#### Difficulties

##### Alzheimer's
plaques developed in the brain. Targets identified to did work to prevent disease.
Triglyceride protein, lipoproteins take cholesterol to different places in the system CTP plays key roles, so the idea was to inhibit protein, lower the amount of good cholesterol, increases the level of bad cholesterol. 
Dalcetrapib and anaceptrapib drugs developed, when the trial was started increased blood pressure, and patients started dying. Targets must be better identified researchers tend to fixate on one target. 

For example, in acetylplumbagin, a very simple molecule. Only kills specific type of cancerous breast cells in cell studies. In mouse studies reduce growth of tumor by 45\% in 21 days. Tried to identify what expression of which genes ATP is changing. AP depletes cholesterol from cell membranes of cancer cells, in effect killing them. Target of AP was found to be CTP. Knock out CTP from cancer cells, within 6 days slows down growth by 20\%.

>NOTE: Cholesterol particularly important for neutrons. 

So CTP failed target for atherosclerosis, but know already that if targeted for cancer it will not affect all that much as already tested for safety. 

>NOTE: Repurpose both target and drug molecule. 

### Sanofi vaccinations. 
Opened collaborative projects, you keep patent. Very competitive market as very few actually developed further. 

Computer models, supportive science, helpful during the screening phases, for example testing 100000 molecules shortlist to 10, 000. 

must always be experimentally validated. 

Downstream is what happens to final porduct ie protein upstream will be effect on genetics. 

### Hit identification 
So many potential chemicals, for example CAS database has 143 million small molecules organic and inorganic. Rules are developed by filtering.

#### Lipinski's Rule of five. 
The molecular weight should be less that 500, 
$log(P)$<5 (related to solubility.)
less than 5 H bond donors. 
less than 10 H-bond acceptors. 
less than 10 rotatable bonds. Developed by looking at the current drugs developed. Not all drugs in the market will follow all of these rules. 

After this virtual screening starts. 
Keep narrowing until reasonable number achieved may be 500,000- 1 million for pharma, for university team more like 5-20. Some groups seem key, but other parts of the molecule can differ significantly. However a similar structure is not necessarily required for a similar function. Another example is in SSRI's where the structure of the drugs can differ significantly. 

### High throughput screening
physical and virtual.
requires robots, as not practical for humans to use.i

developed as accepiate (solubiliser of a drug), for 35 drugs. So might come as aschlerotherosis drug. 


>NOTE: IND filed for before preclinical. 

Once the class of molecules is identified, (the leads). Start with in vitro applications. Plumbagin is a good molecule, but it is very toxic.

Molecule is changed slightly to see if there is a variant which performs better than the parent molecule.

For a clinical candidate there are many concerns to be juggled, safety, solubility, blood brain barrier for brain, can drug survive intestine environment. 

Only particular ion channel, disturbance of one leads to sudden death, monitoring of STRG. What is the risk of side effects, ie what other targets are there what else may it disturb in the cell.absorption and metabolism of drug, should not be metabolised too quickly which goes to pahrmacogenetics, and possible dose adjustment.

## Review
must know the disease and the target, the therapeutic target is the molecule to be taken forward for development, high throughput screening, look at the potential indication. Screening done at multiple phases, to try and cut down on which molecules are probable going to be effective, when molecules are assessed together and no one by one the screening is high throughput screening. The next task is to identify the lead molecule. 

Bioassay
Quantitative or qualitative analysis of a substance that uses a living system, such as an intact cell,as a component. 
Often know what is being looked for. 

Broad categories. 

#. Virtual screening 
#. primary bioassays
#. secondary bioassays
#. preclinical trials
#. clinical trials

## Virtual (_In Silicon_) screening
If chemical space over $10^{60}$ conceivable compounds, screening of libraries of compounds virtually . Lead optimization prediction of structure activity relationships, and save time money and efforts. 

Tell about structural change conformation change efficiency of binding etc. 

Enzyme based essays. Primary bioassays , for example cytotoxicity essays. 

Secondary bioassays are much more complex they are in vivo and far more complex. 

>NOTE: preclinical trials are secondary bioassays as things are done in vivo. 

### Assay properties
key considerations, 
relevance (for example is targeting all kineses or only those of interest)
robustness (does it change with change in method/ environment)
reliability (must be able to consistently provide the same result. 

### High throughput screening
96-well 100-200$\mu L$, robot has pin head to drop in samples from wells. 1000 compounds, 8 plates a fay, ---

Data analysis and Management, software, documentation and reporting.

### Considerations
very expensive, establish high throughput in 10 universities, collaboration of university with pharma. 80million pounds from European facility. Not one in Africa. Contracts with universities outside south Africa screen there, giving away material, and no opportunities for south African students. Using animals for studies is not easy. Put cells in chip. Combines cells from all organ's. 

## Biological targets

Affect of expression of target on on disease, and rest of the cell. 

>DEFINITION: Druggable, any biological entity which can be targeted by a drug. 

Can consist of a small molecular weight chemical compound SMOL or biological BIOL such as an antibody or recombinant protein. Drug development shifting from small molecules to biological molecules essentially training the immune system to fight the disease. 

Targets are the genes and proteins which can be targeted. 
After all vitamins, over 21000 marketed drugs but theses products contain fewer than 1400 unique molecules that create a positive impact through interaction with 324 targets. Only three hundred and 24 have so far been targeted by drugs. Estimated about 5000 targets available for SMOL and 3200 for BIOL. 

Some genes are nor Druggable as they are not yet sufficiently understood.

### Target Identification 
COPY identification strategies. 

### Target Types
There, are four basic types of targets

#### enzymes 
>DEFINITION: Enzymes are biological catalysts. 

Enzymes lower the activation energy
For example carbonic anhydride fulfills a very important role, in removing $CO_2$

>NOTE: An enzyme will lead to two transition states for a given reaction rather than one. 

In induces fit the approach and bonding of the substrate to the active site, can induce a change in the shape of either the substrate or active site. When induced fit occurs the bonds are not easily broken. Product is formed and recycled. Designing molecules with stronger interactions. 

If drug does not bind strongly to enzyme or only binds for short time than drug not very effective. 
co-factors such as ion and zinc are very important cofactors. Many enzymes cannot function in the absence of these cofactors. 

##### Inhibition of enzymes
There are three main types of inhibition 
To inhibit an enzyme the binding of substrate to enzyme must be prevented


#### Competitive inhibitors 
Drug molecule must be similar shape to particular substrate. So thorough understanding of proteins and structure and binding of substrate is required. Binding depends on concentration, and is reversed by increasing concentration of substrate

For example Tamiflu


####  Reversible Allosteric inhibitors
Bind to active site and change overall structure of active site. 

>NOTE: Drugs often inhibit many other enzymes. 

Gleevec is a very specific inhibitor developed from a detailed understanding of the protein which is being targeted.
In addition to binding to ATP site some Gleevec binds to allosteric site, and by binding to the allosteric site it activates the Abl protein, binding to the allosteric site can use up the drug. 

Act as non competitive reversible inhibitors

>NOTE: Side effects can be mental as well such as depression related to hair loss and changed physical appearance.  

#### Irreversible Inhibitors
Could permanently stop the function of the enzyme, or worst other closely related enzymes, especially if it is binding to a common active site hundreds of side effects can result.

Binds covalently and due to very strong bond molecule cannot be removed. 

Some examples such as penicillin target non human enzymes so are safe. 

#### G-Protein-coupled receptors 
G protein coupled receptors. The receptors are coupled to G proteins, and act to regulate what enters the cell. Mediate Cellular signally. They receive chemical messages. 

COPY IMAGE

Receive neurotransmitters as well as hormones. 

must be coupled to be active, so act as cellular switches. Activation and deactivation is through GTP or GDP binding respectively so the reaction \newline
$GTP\rightarrow GDP+P_i$  determines their activity. 

Basic structure,  must be drawn.

Messenger will bind to the external domains of the protein, leading to the induction/ transduction of intercellular processes. Transmembrane regions five and six are the most variable regions between different G proteins, TM5 and TM6, theses are the targets of most drugs. 

>NOTE: As G Proteins are so important drugs must be highly specific. 

###### Families. 



##### Pathways

#### ion channels 

#### transporters

### Protein review
Basic amino acid structure. 
primary (Assembly), secondary(folding), tertiary (packaging), tertiary (interaction)

Drugs target theses proteins, targeting a particular protein in the cell. How the active binding site changes and how that affects the protein activity. Can be covalent bonds, H bonds or Van der Waals forces. 


## GPCR's are targeted by ligands which can be any effective drug molecule. The complex is attached to the--. The complex is only active once GDP is phosphorylated. Ligand binding to GPCR and gene protein complex detaches from GPCRs GTPases catalyst the conversion from GTP to GDP, once GDP to GTP compound is active and will bind to Adenylyl Cyclase which converts ATP to cAMP in transduction. The protein kinase A starts in the cell in an inactive form. 

cAMP is converted to AMP by phosphodiesterase. 

### $IP_3$ signalling. 
When the ligand binds to the GPCR the G alpha is activated by addition of GTP. All of the G subunits (alpha beta and gamma) then bind to phospholipase C. The phospholipase C then activates $PIP_2$ which further activates DAG and $IP_3$, leads to release of $Ca^{2+}$ ions from the endoplasmic reticles. Because PKC requires phosphorylation, which require these $Ca^{2+}$. Ions.DAG is phosphorylated freeing it from protein kinase. DAG and calcium ions. 

>NOTE: REACTOM database

## Drug targets
Three drug targets, agonists, antagonists,and inverse agonists. 

### Agonists
Agonist mimics natural ligands producing the same cellular response. 
If binding is good then efficiency is 100\% so same effect as ligand. If binding is not very good only partial response triggered, so partial agonist.

For example in the brain norepinephrine is released and binds to the neutroreceptor of the nerve cell as well as binding to the $\alpha_2$ receptor on the same cell to trigger a negative feedback loop. In autism and neutrodisorders there is constant norepinphrine signal. Dexmedetomidine is used to mimic norepinephrine to inhibit norepinephrine production. The response is only partial. 

Because the normal functioning of the brain cannot be completely suppressed. 

### Antagonists
Bind to GPCRs but completely block them triggering no cellular response, also dependant on strength of binding and concentration. 

### Reverse agonists
block the receptors completely and trigger opposite response to that of the natural ligand for example histamine receptors and GABA receptors. 

### Ligands
Size and complexity of ligands does not matter.

### Ion Channels

The cell membrane has a lipid bilayer which protects the cell. If drug cannot access its target it will not be able to function. There are some drugs which have been developed to help ion channels function optimally. Transmembrane proteins act like a gate. Ion channels are used to target. 

There are a lot of diseases resulting from malfunction of high channels. $Na^+$ and $K^+$ channels must be maintained, ions are also important as they act as cofactors. 

### Patch clamp technique
Micropipette with saline attached to single cell, and electrode to measure changes in potential. PDB has 4287 ion channel structures, theses are the files which are used for virtual screening. 

Gating mechanisms, when the gate is closed once enough ions have entered the cell. 

Categories of ion channels. 

### Ligand gated channels. 
A ligand is required to open or close the gate. Activated in the presence of ligand. For example nicotine acetylcholine. A ligand is required to open the gates. When people smoke nicotine it binds to nAChR and activates the reward centers in the brain. 

Alternative medication Chantix is used as it is only a partial blocker, so less withdrawn symptoms. There are inhibits/ and activators. Drugs can increase activation of ion channels, as well as decreasing them. 

### Functional antagonists 
(Neutrotoxins) for example $\alpha$-neutrotoxins f are a family of peptides from snake venom tightly bind to nACHhR in skeletal muscles preventing acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission through the opening of nAChR cause ING paralyses in sneak bite victims. 

Snake venom has many receptors which can bind in the human body, used as part of many current drugs. Three are snake farms in tiland for snake venom production. 

A ligand is required to open or close the gate. Paralysis can be reversible. 

### Voltage gated channels
Do not require a ligand. Changes in membrane potential around the cell membrane controls the opening and closing of the channel. When the concentration of ions outside the membrane, or when ions are taken into the internal environment the ion channel opens which sufficient ions transported in the ion channel will close. Hyper polarisation had depolarisation 

Hyper polarisation more negative

Depolarisation, less negative. 

In general membrane about -50 to -70 mV. Certain transports exchange ions. Ligands can maintain the sate of ion channels, Some ligands can block the opening to prevent crossing, some ligands bind to protein keeping them in a closed conformation other's can keep the channel open for a long time, ligands are not required for opening or closing however. Particular drugs can be used to block a particular protein channel directly. Works on potassium channels and can block a variety of cells. 

Other modulating options, drugs can bind at particular location considered as a form of allosteric modulation. 

Others gaining mechanisms, temperature, pH , phosphorylation.

members of the major facilitator superfamily 


Pgp drug exporters, catch and through out anything entering the cell and throw it back out, protect against xenobiotics, Pgp pumps are overexpressed in cancer cells, so immediately throw out drugs, major cause of drug resistance. Variation in these genes plays role in how individuals will react to the drug. 

uniport single molecules on direction
symport two molecules same direction
Antiport, two move, but in one directions

Concentration will drive the action of the transporters in some cases,passive transport ie glucose transporters. Active transport, ATP required. Transport occurs against the gradient from low to high concentrations. 25\% of resting energy is used purely for sodium potassium pumping. Symport, transport of two molecules in the same direction. 

Genital infections related to diabetes drug, the drug was targeting sodium glucose transporters. Targeting of essential pathways can easily lead to very serious effects, transporter  inhibition very commonly used for neutrotransporter diseases. 

For example Prozac, 

Prozac binds and prevents serotonin from reentering so that serotonin remains in the synapse for a longer time, serotonin will still fulfill its function as a natural ligand. 

### Cocaine
Dopamine transporters, controls how we feel etc, even memory and learning. Will power. Dopamine realsed bind to receptors, cocaine blocks dopamine receptors so no reabsorbed stays there for ling time euphoric feeling. Pleasurable effect to rain, negative side is that expression of transporters is increased. Leads to increased expression so more and more cocaine required. 

Therapeutic indix is a combination of LD/TD50, (toxic dose)/ ED50 (effective dose) should be high.
