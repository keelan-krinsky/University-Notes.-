## Age
the earth is generally considered to be about 4.5 billion years old. 

## Layers

### Crust

#### Continental crust 
More than 35 km deep 

##### Density
$2.6-2.7g\cdot cm^3$

#### Oceanic crust
about 7km deep. 


##### Density
$2.9-3.0g\cdot cm^3$

### Mantle
the mantle acts as a lubricating layer

> NOTE: volcanoes derive from weaknesses in mantle with asthenosphere pushing up to surface.

####Outer mantle

> NOTE the outer mantle and outer crust collectively form lithosphere


#### Asthenosphere
Separated by a temperature boundary of $1300 C^\circ$, plastic, with lithosphere floating above it. 

### Outer Core 
mailable, liquid iron and metal convection leads to magnetic field which protect earth surface from exposure to cosmic rays. 

2900km


### Inner Core
 5500 $C$ solid due to high pressure.
solid iron sulphur
5350 km.

### Ocean Ridges
In 1950s there was enough data collected by ships, for the first scientific map in 1977 of the ocean floor which showed mid ocean ridges. The ocean was essentially spreading by formation of new rock. 20-30mm per year?. 

#### Ocean volume 

##### 1800s
As many boats will lead weight+string, measure out depth as they sail to make a depth profile. 

$1.349 \cdot 10^9 km^3$

##### 2010
$1.332 \cdot 10^9 km^3$

Volume is important in climate change considerations such as sea level size. 

> NOTE:previous to the tectonic plate theory there was the expanding earth theory, the key problem was that there was no obvious source for the growth.
