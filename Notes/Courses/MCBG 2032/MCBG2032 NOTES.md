### Evolution process
The first living molecule must have had the ability to replicate. The earth condensed 4.5 billion years ago out of interstellar gas cloud. Small organic molecules are generated, using energy from lightning or UV radiation energy source. The important small molecules $HCHO$ and $CH_4$ from that perspective the first replicating molecule is considered to be an RNA. RNA's are able to fold as they are single stranded. RNA variation is indicted though many errors in the period of geological time. In a functional sense an RNA has information, and a ribozymes type functionality. 

Ultimately the different types of RNA molecules became specialised for different functions. They evolved into a cooperative system. The advantage of the cooperative system is that it replicates with greater efficiency. If Darwinian evolution is used as the example, then in the RNA world was able to under a form of evolution. Because natural selection operates on the phenotype, different 3D structure and functionality of RNA's constitutes a phenotype, so the RNAs had the prerequisites for evolution, Firstly they contained information (within the sequence of nucleotides), which is the equivalent of a genotype, secondly the 3D folded structure provided the molecule with a phenotype. 

Alternative theory from geophysicists, life evolved from minerals and in particular clays. Clays are able to store information in the form of crystal defects. They are also able to undergo replication, and therefore propagate mutations, implying that they are also subjected to natural selection. The main problem with this explanation is that, firstly there is a lack of fossil support (as no fossils of clays are formed, so no real evidence, secondly there is no suggestion of how the transition from mineral to polynucleotide information occurred, thirdly, unlike in the case of RNA there is no clear link between phenotype and genotype in the clay theory. So no obvious way in which more proficient clays are selected for. It is known that today life is essentially assemblages of proteins, which implies that overtime some of the families of cooperating RNAs develop the ability to direct the synthesis of peptides, overtime. (This process only occurred over evolutionary time), starting with the most common amino acids. RNA-based system transitioning to RNA and protein-based system developing into present day. COPY DIAGRAM. The primitive relationships progressively established a link between the nucleotide sequence and the polypeptide assembled from it. The result would have been the formation of proto-mRNA's (the earliest form of mRNA), where there was a link between the RNA sequence and the polypeptide sequence of the proteins to which it was attached. Within the primordial soup the reactions occurring all relied on random occurrences leading to a stable process over evolutionary time. 

Sometime after the development of early cells, earths atmosphere was replaced yet again. From hydrogen, to $HCN$ to predominately oxygen filled oxidizing atmosphere, the tertiary atmosphere. 

Hereditary information today exists in the form of DNA, but RNA DNA and protein all exist in present day cells. This sequence describes that the three groups of molecules function in a collaborative manner. (they were all around before they were also collaborating.). Although they are learnt as separate entities in fact very small differences between RNA and DNA. Have permitted them to develop distinct functions. The passage of RNA to DNA is relatively simple The information stored in DNA, from RNA to DNA requires a reductive system capable of three things. Firstly, the removal of the 2 prime oxygen from the ribose sugar, secondly, methylating uracil to from thymine. Rather primate group relatively easily added, and thirdly a set of enzymes, most likely a family of primitive ribozymes capable of reverse transcribing DNA from a RNA template (RNA into DNA). Reverse transcriptase is one of the oldest enzymes known. At this point the transition from the RNA to the DNA world has occurred. The transfer of genetic information to DNA has several advantages. DNA is far more chemically stable, through its double stranded nature, secondly, because of its double stranded nature it has a lesser potential/propensity for participation in other molecular arrangements. Including folding on itself. Also the double stranded nature provides a much greater fidelity of replication. Finally, the double strandedness also permits a repair mechanism to operate. Fifthly, DNA permits genes to be linked into sequences of increasing length. Sixthly, and possibly most importantly is the separation, between replication and the expression of the information (as in the central dogma). This separation permitted, firstly information to be stored in single copies, or in the minimum number of copies required for appropriate expression. 

>NOTE: The discovery, of HIV lead to reverse transcriptase study which helped to develop the understanding of molecular evolution. 

Secondly, it allows the information to be replicated in a coordinated fashion, at a specific time, in the S phase. Expression and amplification of information was left to transcription, which is controlled independently of replication, to summarize, the sequence of events was as follows, RNA came first in evolution, having both genetic and catalytic properties. After, efficient protein synthesis evolved, DNA took over the primary genetic function, and proteins the catalytic function. However, RNA was retained as the intermediary connecting the two. (it had to be as DNA cant interact Directly with protein). DNA was also necessary as cells became more complex, that is, they required an amount of genetic information greater than that which could be stability maintained in RNA. 

Possibly the most crucial, next event leading to the formation of the first 'cell', was the development of an outer membrane. This is because keeping the family of cooperating RNA's in a confined area would enhance the reproduction of that species. Secondly, in the selection of RNA molecules according to the quality of proteins which they make could not happen until some form of compartment evolved. 

The requirement for containment is easily fulfilled by any class of molecules which have amphipathic properties, as earth in an aqueous environment, amphipathic molecules naturally assemble into aggregations with the hydrophilic potion in contact with the environment and the hydrophobic potions in contact with one another. Amphipathic molecules of the appropriate shape will spontaneously aggregate to form bilayers, (micelles). Which means that they can form a closed structure with an aqueous interior,i.e a primitive cell. Currently it is known that all cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane consisting of amphipathic molecules, predominately the phospholipids.

Ancestral cell, progenote, was the first primitive protocell had a genome of RNA, and perhaps only up to 100 nucleotides long, this has, last common ancestor of all living organisms. The Urkaryote in the initiator of the line leading to the eukaryotes. Archaebacteria. RNA DNA switch took a long time, not very well understood. There are younger RNAs and ancient DNA in a eukaryotic sense. The cyanobacteria are considered the first photosynthetic organisms. The oxygen from the tertiary atmosphere may have come from these cyanobacteria. 

### Summaries 
Distinct advantages of DNA as a pose to RNA primarily due to its double stranded nature. The expression and application were left to specific steps, ie transcription and translation. 

## Eukaryote based cells
There are some characteristics that identify eukaryotic cells, four in particular are seen as critical. 

#. eukaryotic cells have an extensive system on internal membranes. 
#. they have a cytoskeleton composed of protein filaments/ fibres (well developed)
#. they have a distinct nucleus
#. some of the aspects of energy metabolism are compartmentalised. 
	#. That is those aspect's are carried out by distinct organelles. That is by mitochondria and chloroplasts. By endosymbiosis. 

### Serial Endosymbiosis Theory
Mitochondria were first acquired by non nucleated prokaryotic-like cells. Which subsequently developed a nucleus. And then much later acquired chloroplasts. 


>NOTE: Some debate as to how theses cells were acquired, the suggestion is through phagocytosis, through evolution from a feeding mechanism. The alternative theory suggest that a cell which had already developed a nucleus, i.e an early eukaryotic like cell, and then a cytoskeleton, acquired mitochondria and chloroplasts at much the same time. Suggestion came from the idea that plants and animals should have originated at the same time. 

The stimulus for the acquisition (and retention) of an aerobic endosymbiont is considered to be the rise in the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Oxygen toxicity through oxygen free radicals. 


>NOTE: Rise in oxygen concentration was a product of photosynthesis from cyanobacteria. 

Although the prokaryotic cell was established long before the present day bacteria arose, The last common ancestor of Prokaryotes and eukaryotes is relatively close to the branch point. That is the common ancestor was a very long way back so have evolved independently for a very long time. 


### Advantages for eukaryotes
Becoming both eukaryotic and then ultimately multicellular clearly had a distinct advantage. 
Four important points considered:\newline 

#. There is a finite limit to the size of free living individual cells
#. Cells in a multicellular organism are far more versatile than a single cell, There are in excess of 200 distinct cells in a human. All of these cells contain the same cells
#. exploitation of available resources is enhanced when cells from cooperative units. (i.e multicellular)
#. Which the development of cooperative units, such as a tissue in an organ, new properties emerge. Which are not just the simple sum of the properties of the individual cells. For example memory is a product purely of the interactions between brain cells. Emergent property.

## Review
The formation of of a membrane can occur from any amphipathic molecule, in an aqueous environment. Compartmentalisation, mitochondria.

## How Cells regulate their environment (internal and external)
Central to regulation is the plasma membrane. The molecular fluid (lateral movement) mosaic (molecules distributed unevenly) currently describes eukaryotic cells membrane. Major components are lipids or proteins. The lipid composition of plasma membranes is fairly similar from cell to cell, although the proportion of the different lipids varies in different membranes. The type and number of membrane proteins varies considerably between cell types, and between the various membranes within a cell. It is the protein component of the membrane which determines the biological properties of the membrane. Lipids reasonable similar vary differentially. It is the proteins which give the membrane it biological properties, ultimately determining the behavior of an organelle, or a cell. 

If the proteins are so important, what maintains their position on/in the membrane. 

### Peripheral proteins
The peripheral proteins interact with the membrane components in several ways 

#### Ionic interactions or Hydrogen bonding
bond to polar heads of the lipid molecules. 

#### Hydrophilic
Protein inserts hydrophilic loop, or an amphipathic segment, which is most commonly an $\alpha$

### Integral Proteins
Despite there being hundreds of integral proteins described they all interact with the non polar tails/interior through a portion of the protein which has $\alpha$ helices or $\Beta$ strands. When they are anchored by a single transmembrane segment it is most commonly an $\alpha$ helix. For example Glycophorin, (the basis of the ABO blood groups). Proteins which have multiple transmembrane segments, anywhere between 2 and about 18, use $\alpha$ helices and or $\Beta$ strands, or $\Beta$ barrels. For example bacteria Rodopsin has seven membrane spanning $\alpha$ helices. Porin proteins, have an 18 strand $\Beta$ barrel. Many proteins are held in place in the membrane by being covalently linked to lipid molecules. The lipid components insert into the bilayer and act as anchors for the protein. These covalently bound lipids have a role in addition to just acting as anchors. These covalently linked lipids act as anchors and in addition can modulate the activity of the protein. Theses lipids can also be transiently attached to the protein, i.e. they can reversibly attach and detach from that specific protein, which provides a 'switch', which alters the affinity of the protein for the membrane. This reversible lipid anchoring plays a role in the control of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells. 

There are four different types of lipid anchoring motifs 

### Amide-linked myristoyl anchors
Central to this molecule is myristic acid/ tetradecanoic acid. Relatively common saturated fatty acid. Linked by an amide bond to the amino group of the N terminal glycine of the selected protein. The reaction is referred to as N maristoylation. The catalytic subunit, of the CAMP dependant kinase. The phosphatase calcineurin, is an example of a cyclic AMP dependant kinase/ phosphatase. The $\alpha$ subunit of the G proteins is also an amide lined myristoyl anchor, and so are GAG proteins of certain retroviruses. 

>NOTE: Without anchor protein would be pushed straight out of the membrane.

>NOTE: Nearly all proteins have a covalently bonded attachment. 

>NOTE: Some integral proteins have an orientation as well as an anchor. 

### Thioester-linked fatty acyl anchor
Thioester-Linked fatty acyl anchors, which bind a variety of cellular and viral proteins. Fatty acids, covalently bound via an ester linkage, to the side chains of cysteine. In addition, they can be similarly bound to some serine, or thrionine residues. 
This type of fatty acyl chain has a broader range than N maristoylation. Myristate, parmuitate, and stearate., oleate, can all be esterified in this way. For example, the G protein coupled receptors and many surface glycoproteins or viruses. 

### Thioether-linked prenyl anchors
Prenylation is the addition of hydrophobic molecules to a protein. Facilitate attachment to plasma membranes, They are long chain groups that are derived from isoprene units. It generally involves farnesyl and geranylzgeranyl groups. Prenylation of proteins, for anchorage occurs at the cysteine residue of a C-terminal Cys-A-A-X. (terminal), where A is any aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid. For example, Yeast mating factors, p-21 RASP protein (proto-oncogene becomes oncogene and promotes metastasis cancer), , nuclear lamins (structural components of the nuclear laminar)

### Amide-linked glycosyl phosphatidylinositol.
Each type is used by a variety of different proteins, But each has a characteristic pattern of structural interaction. 

>NOTE: referred to as GPI anchors, or GPI rafts. 

There are structurally more complicated than the simple prenyl of fatty acyl anchors. The GPI groups, modify the carboxy terminal amino acid of a target protein, via an ethanolamene linked to an oligosaccharide. GPI groups anchor a variety of surface antigens. Cell adhesion molecules and cell surface enzymes such as the hydrolases. GPI anchors have not yet been discovered in Prokaryotes or plants. Cellular homeostasis. 

## Environments regulation Maintenance of a particular set of parameters, both outside and inside of a cell. The concentration of a particular ion inside a cell, is usually different from that of a surrounding medium. All living cells contain a much higher concentration of $K^+$ than the surrounding medium, and a much lower concentration of $Na^+$ that the surrounding medium. Mammalian cells maintain a $[K^+]$ up to 40 times greater than the surrounding medium. Maintain a $Ma^+$ concentration 15 times lower than surrounding environment (i.e tissue fluid). $K^+$ is required for certain metabolic processes, where as $Na^+$ inhibits many of these processes. The inside of a cell should ideally be electrically neutral. Most cells contain a $Cl^-$ content much lower than the surrounding medium in order to get rid of excess negative charge. Because many of the fixed constituents, i.e those that are too large to move in and out of the cell, (such as nucleic acids and certain proteins), are negatively charged. Mammalian cells also maintain a low $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, changes in internal calcium ion concentrations are used to trigger many cellular responses to external stimuli. Transport of ions across a membrane sets up, a concentration gradient, and an electrical gradient, which in combination is referred to as the electrochemical gradient. An important outcome of this transport is that theses gradients store energy. This energy can be used to generate ATP among other things. Energy at the membrane is required to transport other substances across the membrane, ATP is use to facilitate the transport of Sugars, amino acids and certain metabolites. 


### Review. 
Ion concentrations, $Cl^-$ solves electrical problem. 

### Ion pumps 
There is a diffusion component of ion movement across the cell membrane, (down the concentration gradient). Plasma membranes are inherently leaky, For example the potassium leak channel. The Cell maintains the ionic balance which is required by actively pumping ions into and out of the cell. This is achieved through the action of ion pimps which move ions across the membrane by active transport (i.e. energy requiring, the energy required is provided in the form of ATP, which is converted enzymatic by the enzyme ATP's which is normally an integral part of the ion pump. There are ion pumps which are specific for all pf the physiologically important ions. The most well known ion pump the sodium potassium pump/ sodium potassium ATPase. The sodium potassium pump simultaneously moves sodium ions out and potassium ions into the cell. The sodium potassium pump is a pair of identical catalytic protein subunits, and another pair of membrane glycoproteins. The catalytic activity is located in the cytoplasmic side of the catalytic subunit. For every molecules of ATP which is hydrolysed three $Na^+$ are transported out of the cell and two potassium ions are transported into the cell. 

COPY CYCLE for A
sodium potassium pump. 

Binding of sodium ions and ATP hydrolysis, results in the phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit, which in turn causes a conformational change of the Pump protein, which naturally results in the release of the sodium to the outside of the cell. In this conformation potassium outside of the cell is bound by the pump. Potassium bound results in a phosphorylation to the original conformations re;eases the potassium ions to the  interior of the cell. As a measure of the importance of this pumps action to mammalian cells, which uses a third of their total energy to driving this pump. 

Other ion pumps include Calcium pumps in which the Calcium ATPase is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, creating a store of calcium in the ER, (pumps into ER), the release of calcium leads to a number of cellular events. Ion pumps in internal membranes. Provide a means by which organelles such as, mitochondria chloroplasts, ER, and the central plant vacuoles can maintain internal ionic environment different to that of the cytoplasm, theses ionic difference for example between the mitochondria and cytoplasm are vital to many of the organelle's functions. Ionic gradients which are maintained by the cell, result in an electrical potential across the plasma membrane referred to as the membrane potential, In general the interior of a cell is generally electrically negative with respect to the exterior. The membrane potential in animal cells is generated and maintained, predominately through the activity of the sodium potassium pump. Potassium is continually leaking out of the cell. Through the potassium leak channel. This loss of positive charge leads to the interior of the cell becoming electrically negative. This generates the membrane potential. 

There is a potassium leak channel which potassium slowly leaks out through. The creation/ generation of the membrane potential tends to retard the loss of potassium ions from the cell. At a particular membrane potential the tendency for potassium to move out via the concentration gradient becomes balanced, by the electrical gradient retarding that flow. At this point the membrane potential stabilises, at a value that is referred to as the resting membrane potential. The potassium leak channel is also slightly permeable to sodium, therefore the sodium potassium pump is part of maintaining the concentration gradients across the membrane. If it was not for the sodium potassium pump there would be an equilibration between the inside and outside of the cell, the membrane potential would disappear, and the cells would loose the ability to behave appropriate. 

### Ion Channels
There is a broad categorisation few ion channels into open channels and gated channels 

### Open channels
The open channel is a membrane protein enclosing an aqueous pore. The membrane protein isolates the channel from the surrounding lipids of the membrane. In contrast to ion pumps movement through the channel requires no energy expenditure, the movement of ions through a channel is via aqueous diffusion. Ion channels are generally selective for particular ions and some are permanently open, an example being aquaporins for example the potassium leak channel. There is a basic distinction between those that allow cations to pass and those that allow anions to pass through them. Important cation are soi um and potassium important anions are carbonated ions and chloride ions. Many channels are not permanently open but rather open only transitivity in response to a particular stimulus, these channels typically occur in cells whose activity requires that they respond to both external and internal activity. There are two forms of gated channels, those that respond to the binding of a signal molecules, (a ligand), called ligand gated channels. And secondly those that open in response to a change in the membrane potential. There is an interesting variation. Theses gated channels may sty open for varying times, anything from a fraction of a millisecond to several milliseconds. The binding of a ligand/ of the voltage change causes a conformational change in the structure of the channel protein, which opens the channel. These ion channels are best understood from nerve and muscle cells but occur in all mammalian cells just in different proportions. The ability of a channel; to respond can be altered by biochemical modifications, e.g. phosphorylation. These modifications can permanently or semi-permanently shut down a set of ion channels having a long term effect on the behaviour of a particular cell. Ligand gated channels. The best studied ligand gated channels are those that are receptors for neurotransmitters, in the membranes of nerve cells, and certain muscle cells, for example acetyl choline and GABA. They bind they ligand and allow the passage of ions. The ligand binding sequence of the ligand gated channels are considerable similar and thus are considered as a superfamily of proteins derived from a common ancestor. The amino acid sequences of ligand gated channels are very similar. 

Voltage gated. Open in response to a change in membrane potential. Only open when the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold value. Clearly part of the channel protein is specialised to detect these voltage changes. Again, the best known come from nerve and muscle cells, where one of the common functions, is in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Voltage changes lead to channel opening the movement of ions through the channel causes neurotransmitters release. Unlike the ligand gated the voltage gated channel is made up from a single large polypeptide (around a thousand amino acids). Single large polypeptides also appear to have been derived from a common ancestor. 

#### Channel blockers 
Many drugs and poisons are known to block ion channels preventing ion flow. Certain local anesthetics, and ganglia blockers inhibit the transmission of ions. 

Epidural is a ganglion blocker, likewise antidisrythmic drugs used to treat certain heart block hear channels ($\Beta$ blockers)
The poison, tetrodotoxin from puffer fish blocks the sodium channel involved in the conduction of nervous impulses, leading to suffocation as lungs shut down. There are some channel regulators. 


### Review 
open channels require less energy, gated are also open but they are gated by ligand binding. I love you - The little men. 
In therms of modulating the environment, a component of the functional complex is the gap junction, which allow for intercellular communication, i.e shifting of, Note gap junctions are involved in the regulation of the molecular constituents of cells. There are two ways which you can regulate endocytosis and exocytosis. Most eukaryotic cells carry out endocytosis by one or more of three related pathways. 

### endocytosis 

### Pathways


#### Receptor mediated endocytosis
substances are taken into the cell through an interaction with a membrane associated receptors. 
Takes in growth factors, peptide hormones, blood serum proteins, iron, Vitamins, certain lysosomal enzymes and certain antibodies. 

Some pathogens and toxins use the receptor mediated route. For example cholera toxin diphtheria, and certain viruses. 

The substance to enter to the cell binds a cell surface receptor. These substances bound to the receptor accumulate in depression in the plasma membrane. Such depressions are referred to as coated pits. Because there is a thick layer of protonatious material which lines the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, at high magnification the coating of the pit forms a basket like network. The basket like appearance is a result of the interlocking of a protein network. The protein involved is called clathrin, and the whole structure is referred to as a clathrin coated pit. The clathrin does not link directly to the membrane, it is bound by adaptor proteins which are able to bind clathrin and the membrane. The adapter proteins are also capable of binding the cytoplasmic extensions of the receptors molecules which are trapped in the pit, (it also binds the membrane). The pits Invaginates and pinches free from the plasma membrane, and its now called an endocytic vesicle, as the vesicles form they loose their clathrin coat, and travel into the cytoplasm via the cytoskeletal elements. Within the cytoplasm these endocytic vesicles can fuse into larger , clearly this is an energy requiring process, in this instance it is in the form predominately of GTP. In reality multiple GTP binding proteins participate in coated pit formation invagination and release of the endocytic vesicle. 


# Tomorrows Prac


Very simple prac with lots of time for prelab test. 
Strict ethical regulation orelease some material to the exterior of the cell, in general this process is reffered to a secretion. n animal experimentation lead to more tissue culture, live mammalian cells. Cells are easily destroyed. Confluence leads to death, trypsin EDTA or a combination can be used to split cells. Warm on palm of hand as mammalian cells. Danger of tissue culture is that must remove majority of cells, so record time taken to come off.

#### Bulk-phase endocytosis (Pinocytosis)
The bulk intake of fluid from the surrounding medium. There is no specificity in this intake method, any molecules in solution will automatically enter the cell.

#### Phagocytosis
The material entering the cell is usually large aggregates of molecules parts of cells, and sometimes whole cells. The process resembles receptor mediated, but it is limited to particular cell types. But it is restricted to certain cell types such as, and MAST cells. Look at cells first, must be able to see cells on the bottom of the dish. Don't confuse colonies with cells. The biological waste must go in the receptacle. 

## Review
Pinocytosis /bulk phase, phagocytosis, receptor mediated take up. 
 
### Receptor mediated 
Clathrin coated pits, with a basket network of fibres on the inside formed by invagination of the cell membrane. Substances are taken up in at these pits by endocytosis vesicles. During vesicle movement and fusion the substances in the vesicle are released from the receptors and sorted. 

### Sorting 
Interaction between a signal on endocytosis ligand and receptors on the endocytosis vesicle. (See Diagram). The endocytosis substances may proceed to the ER, the Golgi complex of the lysosomes. This movement is possible in the original endocytosis vesicles or in smaller vesicles which pinch off off from the endocytosis vesicles. The sorting also results in  a set of vesicles being re-routed back to the plasma membrane, (secondary re-routing). Clearly fusion with the lysosomes would expose the contents (internalised receptor or ligand to lysosomal enzymes, leading to enzymatic degradation . The material which returns to the plasma membrane is plasma membrane via exocytosis, This does not happen to every receptor which may be re-introduced into the plasma membrane via exocytosis. This does not happen to very receptor which in endocytosis, but when re-introduction does occur the process in known as receptor recycling. 

>NOTE: not everything degraded in lysosomes is waste, they also are in cellular metabolism. 

### Homeostasis (Exocytosis )
See diagram 
Most cells manufacture and release some material to the exterior of the cell, in general this process is referred to as secretion. Example's of exocytosis molecules, hydrolytic / digestive enzymes various proteins peptides and steroid hormones the components of the extra-cellular matrix. The variety of substances used as neurotransmitters and a range of growth factors. Material to be released is enclosed in small membrane bound vesicles, which travel through the cytoplasm and fuse with the plasma membrane, resulting in the release of the condense to the exterior depending on the type of molecules excreted theses vesicles are given different names, secretory  granules (granulocytes) zymogen granules, (contain precursors, usually of enzymes, inactive enzymes, synaptic vesicles ()contain neurotransmitters. The intracellular route by which materials are packaged depends on the type of material most proteins polysaccharides and proteoglycans are packaged via the ER and Golgi.  Smaller molecules such as neurotransmitters of catecholamines epinephrine , are synchronized in the cytoplasm and selectively transported into performed vesicles. 

#### Frequency 
In certain cases secretion is continuous for example antibodies synthesized by the plasma cells of the immune system. In other cases the material is synthesized and stored in a secretory vesicles, only released when the cell is stimulated by the appropriate signal. Such signals are commonly hormones or neurotransmitters. A common factor which triggers exocytosis in many cells in response to a variety of stimuli is a rise in the concentration of intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ ions. The means by which $Ca^{2+}$ concentration triggers exocytosis in many cells is two fold, The action of the $Ca^{2+}$ ions on components of the cytoskeleton binding to the transport of the secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and secondly the $Ca^{2+}$ concentration induces  the fusion of the secretory vesicle to the plasma membrane, through the individual action of $Ca^{2+}$  which interact with calcium binding proteins. The most well known example being calmodulin. 

### Sorting and distribution of proteins
The signals which direct proteins to various cellular locations are segments of the polypeptide chain, varying from a few to nearly 100 amino acids long. In addition they may be located at a single or several positions on the protein. Almost all proteins targeted to the ER, mitochondria or chloroplast include a signal at the N terminal end which directs the protein to the entry membrane, with only a few exceptions, the N terminal signal is removed after the protein has passed through the entry membrane additional signal segments indicate whether the protein is to be inserted into the entry membrane and determine the orientation within the membrane, (NB: not through the membrane). If the protein is to pass through the entry membrane, additional signals direct it to the compartment enclosed by the membrane. Further signals direct the protein along the extended distribution pathway.  Clearly the signals are recognised by specific receptor molecules involved in sorting and distribution of proteins. The N terminal signal ()directing to ER mitochondria and chloroplasts) Consists of characteristic combinations of charged polar and non polar amino acids, rather than a specific amino acid sequence. The combinations fold into secondary structures that have patterns of charge and polarity that form the signal. This implies that several amino acids may be substituted oar a given position in the signal without altering the N terminal signal Provided that they have similar chemical properties. Proteins targeted to the nucleus have signals which are located within the polypeptide chain, Likewise the nuclear signal also depends on the patterns of amino acids with particular chemical properties rather that a specific amino acid sequence. 

## Research of signals (Fusion proteins)
For example proteins only occurring in nucleus such as histone, Gene sequence for histones Chopped up and recombined molecules made with proteins only occurring in cytoplasm such as actin (all permutations, The recombinant gene was then translated to form fusion proteins t. The movement of the proteins was then followed within the cell (by fluorescent ragging, and eventually the protein segment which direct the protein to the nucleus was identified. 

### ER targeted Proteins. 
The mRNA for proteins to be synthesized on the rough ER, contain a series of nucleotides coding from amino acids which form the ER-directing signal. These mRNA's initiated protein synthesis in the usual manner, by binding to the ribosomal subunits within the cytoplasm, As the ribosomes assembles it begins to translate the mRNA The first segment of the newly emerging polypeptide (nascent polypeptide), contains the ER directing signal. As this segment appears in is bound by the SRP. Along with GTP (energy requiring). SRP signal recognition particle . The SRP in many ways resembles a ribosome it is a relative;y ;are complex of six different polypeptides and rRNA molecule approximately 300nt long. The ribosome SRP complex is recognised and bound by a receptor on the ER. Known as the SRP Receptor/ docking protein, (Creating rough ER). Through this binding the signal is effectively transferred from the SRP to the ER membrane, the signal then penetrates into the ER membrane. If the protein is to enter the ER the growing polypeptide then extends from the ribosome, through the ER membrane and into the ER lumen. GTP hydrolysis release the SRP from the SRP receptor. The binding of the ribosome opens a channel formed by integral membrane proteins, through which the growing polypeptide chain moves. The entry of the growing polypeptide chain is stimulated by other proteins located by both the ER membrane and the ER compartment. Which promote the folding of the penetrating chain , theses proteins are referred to as chaperonins. 


### Endocytosis/exocytosis 
If the protein is to be secreted, the entire polypeptide chain beyond the signal will pass through the ER membrane and into the ER compartment. Soon after the growing polypeptide extends though the ER membrane the N terminal signal is cleaved from the polypeptide enzymatically through the action of signal peptides. Once the protein has moved into the ER the ribosomal subunits dissociate from the ER membrane and mRNA. The signal element becomes degraded. 

The N terminal is made up of three segments the end terminal. The whole signal contains three portions, there are from 1-7 amino acids which form a polar segment (the first segment). This 1-7 usually includes between 1 and 3 positively charged residues such as lysine. The positively charged segment promotes the initial attachment of the signal to the negatively charged ER membrane. The hydrophobic core includes 6-20 amino acids, commonly 12, The important idea is that the amino acids in this sequence are able to form $\alpha$ helices or $\Beta$ strands, which are long enough to span the hydrophobic interior of the ER membrane, promoting the insertion of the signal into the membrane. The third segment contains the sire at which the signal is cleaved after insertion through the membrane. Commonly this region contains amino acids with small uncharged side chains at the first and third positions upstream of the cleavage site. A bulky polar/ charged amino acid at position 2 from the cleavage site. Theses structural features act as the chemical signpost recognised by the signal peptides, Facilitating cleavage, This is all if the protein is secreted. 

If the protein is to remain embedded in the membrane one or more stop-transferred signals within the protein signals arrest the movement of the protein through the membrane. A stop=transfer signal consists of a hydrophobic segment between 8 and 20 nucleotides in length, flanked on either side by charged or hydrophilic regions. The number of stop transfer signals determines the number of membrane spanning segments in the protein, i.e. the number if times it loops back and forth across the membrane. 

### Signals directing proteins beyond the E-
Some proteins entering the RT lumen remain terminal RT directing signal/ and no other signals. The ultimate fate of the protein is secretion.  Others will proceed to organelles such as the Golgi complex lysosomes, central vacuole in plants and the plasma membrane. Directions to these locations depend on the presence / absence of another signal called post=insertion signals. These target the protein to its final destination, secretion is the gate of all proteins which have only a N-terminal ER directing signal. And no other signals, The ultimate fate of the protein is secretion. 

The precise functioning of the signals. The surrounding sequences modify the activity of the signal the default pathway for a protein with an N terminal signal is secretion. 

If the N=terminal signal is followed by one or more stop transfer signals, but with no post insertion signals present, placement in the plasma membrane is the most likely outcome, because of the interaction of surrounding sequences with signal sequences. The precise identity of post insertion signals more of a challenge, 2, are well known. KDEL (Lysine, asparatatic acid glutamic acid, leucine), and mannose-6-phosphate. Proteins which are to remain in the ER compartment have a sequence of amino acids at their C-terminal ends , Removal of KDEL from the protein causes it to be secreted, conversely the addition of KDEL to the C-terminal end of a non ER protein causes it to be retained in the ER. There are  however additional steps , as proteins resident in the ER are not immediately retained there rather they are carried away in transition vesicles , which bud from the Rt and fuse with the Golgi-complex. As the transition vesicle forms, the protein is bound to a KDEL receptor-located on the inner-membrane of the vesicle, these vesicles fuse with the cis face of the Golgi, and are processed with the cisternae of the Golgi, rebound in vesicles at the trans face of the Golgi, which return to the ER fuse and release the proteins into the ER department. 

Proteins/ enzymes in particular which are destined for the lysosome, have post insertion signals which consist of a mannose sugar with a phosphate group attached to carbon 6. The carbohydrate unit is added in the ER, modified in the Golgi, and in a similar bidding process given to the lysosome, This carbohydrate based signal is unique to proteins destined for lysosomes. Glycoproteins are commonly found in the plasma membrane, as non lysosomal glycoproteins do not employ the carbohydrate group in the sorting process, they do not contain specific signals therefore are routed to the plasma membrane. 
tr
Destinations beyond the ER and Golgi, i.e. the mitochondria chloroplasts and nucleus, each of which have specialised signals directing the protein to that destination. Rather that being assembled on rough ER proteins destined for these locations are synthesized on ribosomes which remain freely suspended in the cytoplasm, or attached to the organelle of their destination. 

## Mitochondria and Chloroplasts
The majority of proteins within these organelles are nuclear encoded. Proteins directed to mitochondria have signals specific for the various components of the organelle. Four different signals to send a protein to the correct location within the mitochondria. The default pathway initially directs proteins through both mitochondrial membrane and into the matrix. If required they are secondarily directed to other compartments (i.e either membrane or inter membrane spaces. Default signals can be anything up to 70 amino acids in length clearly longer than any ER directing signals. They contain a long region at the N-terminal end of positively charged residues. There is a central region of the signal which has a stretch of up to 25 polar and non polar amino acids which act as the membrane spanning region, Capable of crossing a phospholipid bilayer. 
r ma
Junk DNA codes for many things, including signalling. There is an N-terminal sequence which directs proteins through the membrane. Post insertion sequences direct signal to a further destination, . Secretion is the default . One signal directs to organelle then rearranged by mitochondria to either of the membrane, the matrix or the intermembrane space. 

### Chloroplasts
Chloroplasts have a sorting and distribution system similar to that of the mitochondria. Signal (N-terminal) 30-100 amino acids long. 

### Nucleus 
Nuclear pores are plugged/ to freely communicating, sophisticated exchange regulation. Signals which direct proteins to the nuclear interior differ fundamentally from other organelle directing signals. Nuclear directing signals can occur at any site within the protein, the signal can consist of more than one segment/ commonly 3 , which can occur at separate sites on the polypeptide chain. Unlike the Rt and some other organelle directing signals, the nuclear signal is retained in the protein sequence once the destination (the nucleus) is reached. Nuclear signals are relatively short , strongly basic, with interspersed receptors which are part of the nuclear pore complex. After binding on ATP dependant mechanism directs the protein through he poor complex and into the nuclear interior. (COPY nuclear pore slide). The modern description. Definition of eukaryotic cells is the unit of function (smallest independent unit,) is the cell and its associated extracellular (Higher organisms are more sophisticated eukaryotes. 

### Extracellular matrix
Almost all cells form extracellular structures which are collectively referred to as the Extracellular matrix (ECM).
