Increasing influence of fluvianl forms (i.e. terraces.)

#### Transeverse. 
There is a lateral decrease in fluvial depositis moving uphill from the river. 

#### Combined affect. 
In the hills, by the streams headwaters there are no alluvial deposits (sediment is removed from this zone not diposited), so no real physical heterogenaity exists, there is no obvious Raperian zone and only terrestrial life forms, i.e. broad leafed trees are present. 

Lower down, by the valley bottom, alluvaial deposits are present as well as backswamps and berms. Additional there is enough space now for a Catena gradeint to develop leading down towards the river, which in conjunction lead to much greater variation between the Raperian and terrestrial zones.
