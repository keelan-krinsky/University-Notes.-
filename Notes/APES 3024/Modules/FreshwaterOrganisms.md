# Fresh Water Organisms

## Diversity of freshwater organisms. 

## Biodiversity 
Biodiveristy can be considered at a number of different levels, some important measures of diversity to consider are: 

 #. Species richness.
 #. Relative abundance.
 #. habitat diversity 
 #. genetic diversity. 
 #. Behavioural diversity. 

 In short biodiverity is everything which contributes to variation/variety within a ecosystem

### Species diversity 
Species diveristy can be evalutated in different terms. 

#### Species richness. 
Species richmess is simply a measure of the number of distinct species within a given ecosystem/area. 

#### Endemism. 
Endemism is a measure of how spacially restricted somed species are. A ecosystem with a high number of organisms restricted to it will have a high endemism and so will  be important with respect to conservation biology. 

### Marrine systems. 
Marrine system tend to be more diverse in regard to higher taxa (i.e. classes and orderes as a pose to species), which means they are, in some regard at least more diverse. For example seas contain many differnt phyla, such as echinoderms, jayfish, and authropodds. 

### Drivers. 
The patterns seen in biodiversity are driven by biological processes, (operating at different size and time scales. ) Organisms are adapted to the condition in which they live and the resources avaiable to them, which consitutes their fundamental niche. A organism can only survive in a limitted range of variations around this niche. The morphology, behaviour, and life history of an organism is reflect its adaptions to its environment, and also the adaptions of its ancestors. 

For example, The mayfly, has over millions of years develped a effecient body shape. the phylogeny refelcts the modern morphology. Habitat range and currentl geographical ditributaion are reflections of historical events and environmental constraints and opotunities. 

### Fresh water organisms. 
Early evolution of all major phyla occured in the sea. Most phylla evolved in the cambrain explosion (which was an exclusively marrine event). 

### Colonisation of land and freshwater. 

#### Dirrect upstream 
Some animals entered freshwater from the marrine environment dirrectly by swipping upstream from esturies. Prosobranch snails (snails with a gill) plathyelminths, ologocheate, and crustaceans are examples thereof. 

#### Through terrestrial 
Some animals first entered the land and addapted to terrestrial living before later on adaption to a freshwater environment. Insects, flowering plants (actually evolved on land full stop), lunged snails, birds, mammals and reptiles are examples there of. 

NOTE: there organisms often do not live perminantly in the water using it primarily just to feed. 

#### Moviment in ice 
Movement of ice over the surface of the land, in the northern hemishpere during the ice ages, folled by the formation of lakes as the ice receeded could have isolated organisms is the newly formed salt water lakes which later become freshwater. 

NOTE: Insects have not re-entered the sea, but have entered freshwater environments, for several reasons:
 #. There are many other authropods (crustaceans such as decapods/shrimp))already filling the niches which insects would fill, so the competition would be intense. 
 #. Insects reproductive strategy involves egg laying, and eggs would get damaged in rocky shore of stormy sea environments. 
 #. Insects live partly on land, which is difficult in the middle of the ocean. 

All in all after terrestrial adaptation the marrine environment proved too hostile and compeditive, the freshwater did not. 

## Plate techtonics. 
Plate techtonics is well decribed since the Permean period, 286mya. The terrestrial world was all goined to from one large landmass, Pangea at this point, surrounded by the oceans. 

Pangea broke up just north of the equator to form Lurasia and Gondwana land, and the tethys sea was formed. Critically this change lead to a change in hwo water flowwed from the north to the south poles, and a change in migratory patters, which lead to the splitting of phylogenies. 

## Vaceriance. 
Vacarinence is the formation of new species by the imposition of a physical barrier which lead to reproducive isolation of differnt populations of the species. 

For example, the genetic phylogeny of Chiroomids, (non biting midges) which are very abundant in freshwater systems can be used to track the continental rearrangmenr. 
 
 #. South africa split from antartica. 
 #. new zeeland slipt from antartica. 
 #. Australian and east antartica split off from south america and west antartica. 
 
 NOTE: the relatively shallow divergence between Africa and Lurasia is explaned by the fact that theses continents crashed into eachother again laer on, at which point chiomoods species again mixed and interbred. 

## Climate change 
Climate change can change the shape and extent of dryland, primarily through changing seas levels. Climate change occurs at different rates in different peridos, it has occurred at a relatively rapid rate for the last 30 million years. 

### River capture. 
Due to fluctuations in geographic shape and sea level, river patterns can change. 
In the early plastocease the whole of the aguleus bank was drained by the old fish river which flowwed over namibia. Th organhe river connected to the olifancts and entered the sean west of langerbaan. Then the sea levels rose and the orange river changed its course capturing the fish river. Vacarience then occured in the Olifants and Orange rivers. 

For example catfish, Austroglonidid. evolded in the ancinet orange/ olifants system, In the modern Olifants an alleopathic species arose endemic to the Orange (orange/vall catfish), and one endemic to the Olifants (clanwilliams catfish)

### Great lakes. 
In Africa the great lakes, Victorial, Malawe, and Tangnyito show very high levels of diversity. 

COPY diagram 

In particular there is high diversity in chiclids in Lake Malawe. Many different species f chiclid are present, differentaied predominatel by mouth shape. For example there are, scael eaters, eye bites mullosuc crushes, vegitation eaters, etc. Chiclids from the sub family Haplochromine are the root othe the diversity. This diveristy is facillitated by the short generation times of such fish, as well as maternal brooding (where the eggs, and even sometimes the young fish are brooded in the mother's mouth, or nest gaurding (usually  by the father.), Becuase of this reporductive behaviour different species do not intermix. The basic adaptable body plan of the fish allows it to ocupy any given general niche, and its mouth parts can be optimised to avoid competition within this general niche. 

The phsyical drivers of speciation in this case, could be classic alleopathic specieation in rivers followed by colonisation of the lakes or more porbably micrographic speciation within the lakes themselves, dirven by changes in lake levels leading to isolation of groups for periods long enough for speciation to occur. (the time required is shortened considerable by the specific morphological and behavioural adaptions of these fish)

NOTE: river capture occurs when a river changes its course and flows into anther river. 

### History 
In was long oberved by scientists that South america fit rather neetly into Africa, and based on this the theory of continental drift was proposed. However it was not until after WW2 that any mainstream credence was given to this theory. in WW2 antisubmarine sonar technology was developed, which was later used to map out the ocean floor. Large ridges along the ocean floor were discovered

COPY IMAGE. 

These ridges were caused by magma from the center of the earth swelling up, and cooling forming new rock in the process and pushing the old rock asside to make way, which has the effect of pushing the contintents further apart. Continents can also be brough together if two plates meet and one slodes under the other. 


#### True Dirrect 
A very small number of organisms may have evolved dirreclty in freshwater systems.  


## Organising understanding of diversity 

there are differetn scales to understand diversity

#### Ethiopian 

##### Fauna 
Species that evoleved within the continent afrer the split from Pangea. in addition to fauna that entered from the north, after the closing of hte Tethys Sea. 
Oriental. COnsits of two components the southe temperate Gondawanian forms and the Pan-Ethiopian forms. 

###### South temperature Gondawanian 
Found on the tip of africa but also in antartical and mnay other regions, (they are all found within specific distance from the equator. 
Today theses animals are restricted to cooler mountanous areas, normally restricted to waterbodies which remain cool all year round. SSuch animals are ofter Stenotherms, toerate very low temperatures range with a very low maximum temperature at which they can survive. 

Relict families shared among southern Gondwanan regions like New Zealand e.g. Corydalidae. (dobsonflies), such animals used to be far more widespread but are now marginalised. 

###### Pan Ethiopian fauna 
Evolved in the northern part of africa when it was moving throuhg the tropical region. they form the bulk of african fauna related to tropical african biota. 
this group is further divided into 
 #. the original tropical Gondwanaland (tropical Gondwanian forms)
 #.those that entered Africa after the Tethys Sea Closed. 
 

NOTE: As africa moved north in the split up from Pangea, the cold temperate regions became tropical, so animals moved south to stay within their fundamental niche. leading to many extinctions.

### Continental 
biogeographic subregions 

### Regional 
ecoregions , the current constraints animals face. 

There are 31 recognised/categorised aquatic ecoregions in South africa. theses regions are based on topography rainfall and geology. The rivers have similar physco-chemical features and thuse similar biota (as biota have the smae constraints. 

For example in the waterburg there is subbtropical climate, low nutrient clear water flowing of the mountain. 

In the northern excaspment there is a mixture of sedimentary ignious rock, so higher natureal nutrient content, lower climate, with a mix of subtropical and tempaerate climatae. 

 Low filed 
 high accumulated sediment, and nutrient levels, high temperature as subtropical and low donw. 
 Summer rainfall. 

 western floded montains 
 low nutrient clear streams low termbidity, but in mediteranian climate, cold wet winter. )

### Catchment
zones and habitat types, Tranferable across all ecoregions to a large extent. 
IN lotic ecosystems , faunal communities occur in two zones 

#### rhithron 
mountain streams and rivers 
1st second and sometimes 3rth order streams 

#### potamon 
big lowland streams/rivers. 
3rd 4th 5th etc  however the division between rithric and potamic communities is not static or consistent.

zoning in europian rivers. 
The potamonic zone is split into an upper (epi potamon) and lower section (meta-potamon). Note more turbulent water to calmer, decrease in sediment size, more macrophyte growth, (IN SA too much turbidity for large macrophyte growth). Forested head streams with grassland low rivers, in SA however headwaters may not be forseest, bu grassland or savannah rather. Flooding is more violent in the smaller streams than in the bigger streams, and there are more aquatic preditors down stream (as the habitats are larger) in the headwaters, with smaller habitatis there are more terrestrial preditors. Europenas call the Rhithron the Troat zone , the Eip-P the Barbel zone and the meta-potamon the Bream zone. Trout is a stelotherm so can only survive in cold well oxygenated water so must be in head waters. 
In the lower waters animals can live in warmer waters but require rocky substrate to form on, such as the american small mouth bass. In the lowland the european carp, eats mud/mud siffter, and lays eggs on aquatic macrophytes. .  In south africa the equivalent up water fish is the meloty minnow, whihc is a gondwanian fish, (trout is stocked in large regoins and must share restircted habitat , also trout feed on these minnows, (the minnows are insectivors only)). Lower down,orange river catfish in the middle,   the large mouth yellow fish is only found in big open waters, and lare large  piscivours. 

### Zonation in lentic comunities. 

#### Pelagic 
organism found in open water (oceans + lakes. 

##### Plankton 
passively moving 

##### Nekton 
actively moving. 

##### Limnetic 
shallow pelagic, still light 

##### profundal zone 
very little light. 

This zoning holds true for lentic ecosystems and in areas of low flow in rivers. which are sufficiently deep and large. 


#### Benthic 
by the bottom of rivers and lakes. 
)

##### Benthos.
organimss lving on the bottomanimals living in or on the substrate of the habitat 

#### literal/shoreline,
close to the edge of water bodies.  

#### Neuston 
surface of the water and just below it 

there will be different proportions of these communities in different water bodies, i.e. the size and shape of the water body determies the extent of habitaits available. 

For example in lake geriep there will be a large pelagic zone as it is depp and wide. or in a wetland there will be, literal dominated or in a larger wetland possible bethic dominanted.

## Organimms living on the epineuston or under the hyponeuston water surface. 

Thin organic film, trapped by surface tension, which can provide a food source. 
Epineuston: hemiperterans, coleopteranns. 

Worly gig beetle, sits in surface tension, half body above half belw, eyes above to hung eyes below to see and avoid fish. Hyponeuston example would be a mosquito larva whcih essentially havew  snorkel, which protrudes out of the water, theey are also very vulnerable to fish. Some microorganisms such as rotifers, protozonas and codepis make up the microfauna in the hyperoes, whihc is an interstitial water among particles at the bottom of river channel, or lake bottom. Fauna comporises mostly copepods, rotifers, protozons. 

can be a perminant habitat or a temperary refuge, such as burrowing fish in newzealand river. Energy budgets and Food webs,
