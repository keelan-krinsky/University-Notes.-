## Infra Red Spectrometry 
Interact with bond stretch, affecting vibrational energy levels. 


## IR spectra 
IR spectra are very good at identifying specific functional groups present. 
The absorbance spectra, resulting from the distinct absorbance of different bonds is plotted against wavenumber. Some frequencies absorb more than others, which forms the basis for functional group identification. 

### Interaction of radiation. 
IR radiation interacts with the vibrational level associated with bonds between atoms,i.e. bond stretching and bond bending.  The size of the dipole moment changes in the interaction. The larger the change in the dipole moment the stronger the signal. If the bond is symmetrical then there will be no IR signal, i.e. it will not absorb any IR 
radiation. 

#### Important bonds. 
The most important bonds in IR are the bonds that stretch more or less independently of the rest of the molecule. Such bonds are bonds that are much weaker or stronger than other neighboring bonds within the molecule. Bonds in which one atom is much heavier than the other also tend to have strong and distinctive absorption patterns. 

#### Peak classification. 
Peaks are generally grouped into one of four categorized based on the extent of absorption which they represent, (i.e. how low the spectrum falls): very strong, strong, medium, and weak. Peaks may be further described as either sharp or broad depending on the range of wavelengths which are absorbed in interaction with the bond. 

#### Peak position. 
The $\bar{\nu}$ at the lowest point in a peak are taken as the peak position. The section of the spectra from $1500-400-cm^{-1}$ generally focused on as peaks in this region are easier to resolve, in the fingerprint region many overlapping and weaker peaks makes it far more difficult to identify specific bonds. 

#### Equations. 
As bond stretching is being considered Hooke's law which gives the frequency of oscillation for a spring, can be used, that is: \newline 

$v=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}$\newline 
$\rightarrow \bar{\nu}=\frac{1}{2\pi c}\sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}$\newline 
where: \newline 
$k$= The force constant. \newline 
$\mu=\frac{m_xm_y}{m_x+m_y}$= The reduced mass (C-C:6.0, C-H: 0.92)\newline
$m_x, m_y$ = Atomic mass of compounds x and y respectively. 

From Hooke's law it can be seen that: \newline 
$\bar{\nu}\propto k^\frac{1}{2}$


### Informational content
The information gained from an IR spectra is information about bonds, as this is what the IR interacts with. 

#### Quantitative. 
IR spectra can be used to obtain quantitative information about the strength and or length of bonds, calculated suing force constants, however this is not the main application of IR in organic chemistry. 

#### Qualitative 
The main application of IR in organic chemistry is inferring which functional groups may be present, (which is qualitative information). 
Different functional groups have very characteristic IR absorption signals.
The average positions of many functional groups are listed in correlation tables/charts.

NOTE: The electronic component of the IR radiation is involved in the interaction, not the magnetic.

#### Key peaks to memorize. 

##### Stretching vibrations. ($4000-1500cm^{-1}$)

##### Stretches and bends $<1500$
Other C-X bonds such as C-O stretches and C-F or C-Cl. 

NOTE: this region is known as the fingerprint region and isuseful in matching spectra. 

 ### Vibrational energy levels. 
Vibrational energy levels can be as-sociated with change in bond length and bond angle, stretching requires more energy than bending, (i.e a higher wavenumber.)

#### Polyatomic molecules
Neighboring bonds in a molecule influence each other, which can result in a cummulative / knock-on effect. Independent combinations of vibrational motion are called normal modes of vibration. 

For example, the wavelength absorbed by the C-H bond differs for differnet molecular surroundings as follows: 
	
 #. Alkanes:
 #. Alkenes
 #. Alkynes
 #. Aromatics. 

#### Normal modes of vibration 

##### Symettrical stretching 

##### Asymetrical strerching. 

##### Scissoring

##### Rocking 

##### Wagging 

##### Twisting. 


### Operating range. 
A IR spectra is typically taken over a range of $400-4000cm^{-1}$ ($\lambda=2.5 \cdot 10^{-6}- 2.5 \cdot 10^{-5}$) 

### Infra-red radiation introduces (??) tranformations in molecules. 

### Machine.
The Infra-Red radiation used is obtained from a heated coil. This radiation passes through the sample before arriving at the detector. Some of the incident radiation is diverted to a inferometer which producer a interferogram for the source radiation. This interferogram is decoded by furier tranfer. On its way to the sample the incident beam passes through a specially shaped (normally diamond) crystal to allow for attenuated total reflection (ATR).
