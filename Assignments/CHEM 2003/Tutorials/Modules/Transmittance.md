# Transmittance
Transmittance is a material property relating to how radiant energy moves through a substance. 

## Equation
The transmittance (T) of a surface is given by the expression. 

$T=\frac{I}{I_0}$ 

where: 
>$I_0$ = The intensity of light incident onto the surface
> $I$ = The intensity of light transmitted by the surface.

> NOTE: Transmittance is often given as a percentage.
