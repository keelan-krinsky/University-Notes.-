# Electromagnetic waves

## Wave nature.
Electromagnetic waves consist of and electric and magnetic field which oscillate orthogonally to each other, and orthogonally to the direction of propagation of the wave. 

## Wavelength
Wavelength is donated by $\lambda$ and measured in meters (sometimes nm are used such as when UV or visible light is being discussed). 
 
## Velocity
Speed is donated by $c$. The speed of light in a vacuum ($c_0$) is constant ($3.00 \cdot 10^{8}m\cdot s^{-1}$), normally the speed of light is given in $m\cdot s^{-1}$ 

## Frequency
Frequency is donated by $\nu$ (?) and is measured in Hertz (Hz) that is $s^{-1}$

## Wavenumber
Wavenumber is donated by $\overline{\nu}$, and is the reciprocal of wavelength. It is measured in $cm^{-1}$ and used most commonly in IR spectra. 

## Particle nature.
Photons are particles of light. There particles posses a distinct quantised energy given by $E=h\nu$

># Beer-Lambert Law
>The Beer Lambert law related the attenuation of electromagnetic waves to the properties of the material through which they are propagating and the distance which they have propagated through the material.

>## Equation.
>For a particular wavelength incident on a suspension of absorbing particles the Beer Lambert law is given by:\newline

>$A=\epsilon bC$

>> $A$ = Absorbance \newline 
>> $\epsilon$ = Molar absorptivity ($L\cdot mol^{1-}\cdot cm^{-1}$)\newline 
>> $C$= Concentration of absorbing particles.
