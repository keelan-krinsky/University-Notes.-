## Questions

## One

Individual in the context fo a unitary organism implies that the organism has a unique genetic make up. (distinct from other individual in the same area/ of the same species)

Individual in the context of a modular organism implies some form of physical separation between individual (or morphological distinction). Such individuals are morphologically connected, and genetically identical but may still display phenotypic plasticity-slightly differing phenotypes- depending on their immediate physical surroundings

#### Annual
A plant which has a life cycle which lasts over the period of a single year. this life cycle  includes:
1.  germination
2. juvenile phases(seedlings)
3. An adult phase (in which the organism is capable of reproduction)
4. senescent/ dying phase.  

these plants tend to be herbaceous, and relatively small.

#### Perennial

Plants which have a life cycle which extend over many year. the essential stages of their life style however remain the same as those of annual plants.  

these plants tend to be large and woody.

#### Semel- parous

Insert Graph.

Semel-parous individuals have a long juvenile phase, which takes up the majority of their life, followed by a single reproductive event just before their death.

#### Iteroparous

Iteroparous individuals can reproduce many times/ continuously through their adult life before senescence sets in.  

##### Examples

###### Annual Semel-parous.

PLANT: _Amaranthus cruentus_

ANIMAL: _Dolania Americana_ (A mayfly species)

###### Annual Iteroparous

PLANT:-------
ANIMAL:_Anopheles albimanus_ (Mosquito Spp)

##### Perennial Semel-parous.

PLANT: _Lobelia telekii_ (Centuary Plant)

ANIMAL: _Sepioteuthis sepioidea_ (Caribbean reef squid)

#### Perennial Iteroparous.

PLANT: _Quercus alba_ (White Oak)

ANIMAL _Tragelaphus strepsiceros_ (Kudu spp)

Annual Iteroparous plant species proved very difficult to find, (although no source seemed to specifically negate their existence). Perhaps the reason why so few/ if any annual plant species are Iteroparous is because the resource necessary to fuel reproductive activity take any given plant too long to accrue for 2 or more reproductive events to feasibly occur in one season.

### Three

#### Aggregated
Individuals are not evenly distributed but rather grouped into areas of higher density, with groups separated by (normally large) areas of lower density.

This distribution may result from a scattered resource distribution, with high density areas surrounding high concentrations/amounts of these resources.It could also be caused by social factors which lead to aggregation into large herds, as the predominant social structure.

#### Random

In a random distribution individuals are evenly distributed with a (relatively) constant population density throughout.

A random distribution will occur almost as a default distribution if there is no underlying pattern of resource scarcity, or inter and intra species interactions which could cause emergent patterns/ properties in the  population density distribution.

#### Regular

In a Regular distribution there is a set patten/ organisation to the distribution of individuals, (usually as an emergent property of the movement patterns of the individual themselves)
 which exact pattern emerges will depend on the specific population under consideration.

 regular arrangements may be as a result of intra species social structures such as territorial behaviour. Alternatively it may result from interspecies interactions such as the  regular arrangement of plant in Anthromes for agriculture, or landscaping.

### Four

Because most of South Africa in terms of total surface area,is virtually uninhabited (by humans). On a day to day, most South Africans live in high density cosmopolitan settlements, or at least medium density rural settlements, concentrated into a very small percentage of the total available area.

A similar contrast may appear in other species as a result of aggregate population distribution, or if a given population was in the process of migrating into a new much larger territory.

Such a Contrast may not be seen in a population which has reached the carrying capacity from a given area, and is randomly distributed in that area> furthermore population with regular distribution, depending on the specific distribution pattern may not show this contrast.

### Five

For unitary organisms genetic differences between individuals can lead to a degree og nick differentiation. furthermore as individuals are not physically connected intraspecific competition will lead to a certain maximum population density.

For modular organisms, although individuals may compete to an extent for resources, detriments to one individuals may by extension detriment other individuals in the network which were deriving some resources from the individual in question. As a result competition is commonly limited by hormonal activity between individuals in the network. to prevent individual from negatively impacting on each others growth.
 Phenotypic plasticity can also reduce competition, both at the individual and population level, although unlike with unitary organisms it is unlikely to lead ultimately to speciation.
