### Lewis structure of $Si(OH)_4$
,_

#### Step #1
Number of electrons = 4x6 +4x1 +1x4 = 32.

#### Step #2
After 8 electrons are assigned to each oxygen, and single bonds are formed between each species all species have a full octet, (except for hydrogen which has a full valence shell consisting of two electrons)

NOTE: As silica is a period two element overfilling of the octet is possible however any additional bond formation between the oxygen and the central silicon could only increase the formal charge and so may be discounted.

## Two

### (i)

#### Step #1
Moles of EDTA added to EDTA standard

$= \frac{0.914g}{372.24g.mol^{-1}}$
$= 2.4554 \quad x \quad 10^{-3}mol$

#### Step #2
Average Titrant volume
$= 0.5x ((4.57-0.04)+(5.13-0.10))ml= 4.78ml$

#### Step #3
Moles of EDTA in Titrant

$= 2.4554 \quad x \quad 10^{-3}mol \quad x \quad \frac{4.78ml}{250ml}$

$= 4.6947 \quad x \quad 10^{-5}mol$

### (ii)
#### Step #1
At equivalence point of the titration all of the EDTA has reacted with calcium at the ratio of 1 mol EDTA: 1 mol calcium ions.

Hence If $= 4.6947 \quad x \quad 10^{-5}mol$ of calcium where added then $= 4.6947 \quad x \quad 10^{-5}mol$ of calcium ions where used up form the titrand.

#### Step #2
As the titrand contained only 25ml of the original calcium chloride zeolite solution, It can be interpolated that
$3 \quad x\quad 4.6947 \quad x \quad 10^{-5}mol= 1.4084 \quad x \quad 10^{-4}$   
of calcium ions would have been used up from the entire solution.

### (iii)


#### Step #1
Moles of Calcium chloride present in the original solution.

$\quad = \frac{0.196g}{219.08g.mol^{-1}}$

$\quad = 8.9465 \quad x \quad 10{-4}$

#### Step #3
Moles of Calcium ions left in the original solution

$\quad = 8.9465 \quad x \quad 10^{-4}mol - 1.4084 \quad x \quad 10^{-4}mol$

$\quad 7.5381 x \quad 10^{-4}mol$

### (iv)
Grams of Calcium chloride left in original solution.
$\quad = 7.5381 x \quad 10^{-4}mol \quad x \quad 40.08g.mol^{-1}$
$\quad = 3.0213 \quad x \quad 10^{-2}g$

### (v)

#### Step #1
The amount of calcium ions taken up by the zeolite is equivalent to the amount fo calcium ions remaining in solution, as any calcium ions not bound would have been removed during the EDTA titration.

Hence there are $7.5381 \quad x \quad 10^{-4}mol$ of Calcium ions bound by the zeolite.

### (vi)
#### Step #1
Grams of Calcium ions taken up per gram of Zeolite

$\quad = \frac{3.0213 \quad x \quad 10^{-2}g}{0.104g}$

$\quad = 0.29051 (g/g)$


## Three
This implies that zeolites may be very useful as detergents as they are capable of sequestering/removing relatively large quantities of dissolved ions from solution.
(removing these ions will prevent them from resettling on whatever item is being cleaned, and increase the overall ability of the detergent to dissolve and remove unwanted deposits from the item being cleaned.)

## Four
the IR spectra of the Ester contains a strong peak at around 1743 (wave number) characteristic of the C=O bond within and ester. This peak is close to that caused by the C=O bond present in the acetic acid, by slightly lower at 1706. (the difference in values is due to the affect of the adjacent C-C, (or C-O in the ester) bond, on the main C=O bond.)
th IR on the other hand contains no obvious peaks in this region, but does contain a rather broad peak at about 3330 (wave number) which is with the range associated with and alcohol group (3200â€“3400)

## Five
four acid sites are accosted with the EDTA. (one for each of the terminal carboxylic acid groups)

## Six.
Yes. Sulphuric acid has the same activity of any normal acid catalyst, providing a ready source and sink for $H^{+}$ ions, facilitating
 the internal structural changes necessary for ester formation.

## Seven
Pentyl ethanol is used:

1.  as a flavourant in many foods.

2. As a solvent in paints.

## Eight
Zeolite is micro-porous, that is within its 3D chemical structure there is a regular arrangement  of regular sized gaps/holes/pores,through which other molecules, if sufficiently small could pass through. molecules which are too large however, (such as molecules with a diameter greater than X in the figure below) can. Such molecules suffer size exclusion, as although they may have the correct chemical properties to react with binding sites on the interior, they are physically prevented from reaching these sites, as the are too large, and so cannot bind.

# Aim
Two different experiments where performed with different aims.

The aim of experiment A was to determine the Ability of Zeolite to bind Calcium ions from solution. Both to determine how effective Zeolite could be as a cleaning/filtering agent to remove calcium impurities, and to approximate how much zeolite (by mass) would be necessary to remove calcium from a contaminated solution.


The aim of experiment B was to determine Zeolite ability to act as a Acid catalyst (in esterification.)
In particular to determine if zeolite could be a more effecient/ effective catalyst that a typical lewis acid catalyst.

# Introduction
Zeolites Are complex three dimensional molecules formed from the condensation of $Si(OH)_{4} $_ and $Ai(OH)^{-}_{4}$ monomers. These monomers take a variety of forms including cages, chains, channels and sheets(Cejka, 2007). When these monomers bond together three dimensional structure/nets can be formed.The most striking feature of the complexes formed is the regularly sized and evenly space pores which are most commonly composed of six or eight bonded tetrahedral units, forming hexagonal or octagonal openings in the molecule respectively.  (See the figure below). This regular arrangement has many potentially important chemical applications. One such application is the ability of Zeolites to act as a molecular sponge/filters soaking up particles of the correct size to fit through the microspores which binding to the interior of the molecule via a process of cation exchange. this process can be effect in removing cation contaminants from solution.(Motsi et Al 2009). Furthermore Zeolites can also act as effective inorganic acid catalyst, (provided they contain appropriate ratios of aluminium to silicon subunits). These catalyst have been suggested to be more effective than simple lewis or bronsted acids in catalysing important organic synthesis pathways such as the etherification of glycerol.(Aula et Al 2017). Such catalyst have the added advantage that, as the catalyst is solid state, removal and reuse if far simpler and less energetically expensive than a conventional acid catalyst.

# Calculations.

=35.8mg/L

# Discussion.

## Absorbance capacity of Zeolite
results obtained in terms of absorbance of calcium, calculated as a gram/gram ratio, (and as percentage absorption for the purpose of comparison) Seem to be in concurrence with the results obtained by (Motsi et Al 2009), in testing the ability of zeolites to remove cations from solution. (Motsi et Al 2009) found an inverse exponential relationship between % absorbance and metal ion concentration, with they lower bound of concentrations used (50mg/L) absorbing appropriately 80% of the available calcium ions. the slightly higher value achieved in this experiment is well explained by the lower cation concentration (35.8mg/L as pose to 50mg/L), seemed to confirm the observed relationship between %absorbance and cation concentration. This close concurrence of results however should is not as indicative as it may appear, as there where many other important variables (temperature, or pore size of the exact zeolite used for example) which where not standardized across experiments or accounted for. Given the variation which could be expected to stem from these variables the close concurrence of the final results may be due more to coincidence then underlying mechanisms of zeolite absorbance.

The significance of the results obtained could be improved by repeating the experiment with a range of different zeolite concentrations, by identifying the precise zeolite used, and by accurately recording, and controlling environmental variable such as room temperature.

NOTE: the titration results underpinning all subsequent calculations had a relatively low precision, which undermines the accuracy of the final results

## Acid Catalysis ability of Zeolite.
As relatively few tests where performed on the organic product (the ester) it is difficult to ascertain the effectiveness of the Zeolite catalyst. quantitative measures of percentage yield or levels of impurity present would be necessary to make a conclusive statement. However, the results recorded do suggest.

1. The Zeolite is capable of acting as a catalyst. as the end solution seemed to contain predominately the same main compound (the strong smelling ester) in each case, )

2.the Zeolite may be considered a better catalyst, both because the final compound in the zeolite solution had a more intense smell, and because of the vigoury smell associated with the sulphuric acid solution, suggesting that not all of the acetic acid in the solution had been fully reacted.  

# Experimental procedure.

## Experiment A.

### Preparation of standards
In the first main experiment two standard solutions where prepared, A $\approx$ 0.01M $CaCl_2.6H_2O$ solution and a $\approx$ 0.01M EDTA disodium salt solution. (The exact masses of $CaCl_2.6H_2O$ and EDTA disodium salt can be referenced in the Data appendices.). In each case deionised water was used to make up the solution to prevent unwanted cations or other contaminants from affecting the experiment result.

### Preparation of Analyte.
$\approx$ of zeolite was added to 75ml of the $CaCl_2.6H_2O$ standard solution, and mixed by means of a magnetic stirrer bar for a period of approximately five minutes. Subsequently the zeolite was removed by filtration through a gravity filter. And samples of solution where taken to serve as the analyte for titration against the EDTA di-sodium salt standard solution.

### Titration
titration was performed in triplicate with (Eriochrome black T was used as the indicator).

## Experiment B

### Preparation of initial solutions.
2 solutions where prepared, solution one containing:

|----------------------------------|
|   Glacial Acetic acid | 15ml |   |
|----------------------------------|
| 1-pentanol            | 15ml |   |
|----------------------------------|
| sulphuric acid        | 1ml  |   |  

And solution two containing:

|----------------------------------|
|   Glacial Acetic acid | 15ml |   |
|----------------------------------|
| 1-pentanol            | 15ml |   |
|----------------------------------|
| Zeolite               | 2g   |   |  


## Synthesis
both solutions where then boiled under reflux for approximately an hour.

### Work up
after cooling the solutions where rinsed several times with water to remove any remaining acid or alcohol impurities.

## Testing solutions
finally the solutions where mixed with deionised water to assess there relative densities.
water was then drained off and the solutions were blotted onto tissue paper for their fragrance to be assessed.

# Conclusion
While the experiments performed where insufficient both in scope and accuracy to porive substative evidence for the properties of zeolite, they still agreed closely with the general concensus in zeolite properties, in the field. That is they support the hypothesis that zeolite can be effective at removing cation contamination, and give an indication of the amount of zeolite necessary. Furthermore they sopport the potential effectiviy of aeolites as acid catalyst, suggesting theat they may be more effective and effecient than the mineral acids commonly used.
