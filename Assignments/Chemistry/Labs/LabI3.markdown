### Lewis structure of $Si(OH)$

#### step #1
Number of electrons =32.
#### step #2
after 8 electrons are assigned to each oxygen, and single bonds are formed between
each species all species have a full octet.

NOTE: as silica is a period two element overfilling of the octet is possible however
any additional bond formation between the oxygen and the central silicon could
only increase the formal charge and so may be discounted.
