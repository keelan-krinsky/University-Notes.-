After 8 electrons are assigned to each oxygen, and single bonds are

hydrogen which has a full valence shell consisting of two electrons)

NOTE: As silica is a period two element overfilling of the octet is
possible however any additional bond formation between the oxygen and
the central silicon could only increase the formal charge and so may be
discounted.

\hypertarget{step-1-4}{%
\paragraph{Step \#1}\label{step-1-4}}

At equivalence point of the titration all of the EDTA has reacted with
calcium at the ratio of 1 mol EDTA: 1 mol calcium ions.

Hence If \(= 4.6947 \quad x \quad 10^{-5}mol\) of calcium where added
then \(= 4.6947 \quad x \quad 10^{-5}mol\) of calcium ions where used up
form the titrand.

\hypertarget{step-2-4}{%
\paragraph{Step \#2}\label{step-2-4}}

As the titrand contained only 25ml of the original calcium chloride
zeolite solution, It can be interpolated that
\(3 \quad x\quad 4.6947 \quad x \quad 10^{-5}mol= 1.4084 \quad x \quad 10^{-4}\)\\
of calcium ions would have been used up from the entire solution.

\hypertarget{step-1-6}{%

The amount of calcium ions taken up by the zeolite is equivalent to the
amount fo calcium ions remaining in solution, as any calcium ions not
bound would have been removed during the EDTA titration.

Hence there are \(7.5381 \quad x \quad 10^{-4}mol\) of Calcium ions
bound by the zeolite.

\hypertarget{three}{%
\subsection{Three}\label{three}}

This implies that zeolites may be very useful as detergents as they are
capable of sequestering/removing relatively large quantities of
dissolved ions from solution. (removing these ions will prevent them
from resettling on whatever item is being cleaned, and increase the
overall ability of the detergent to dissolve and remove unwanted
deposits from the item being cleaned.)

\hypertarget{five}{%
\subsection{Five}\label{five}}

four acid sites are accosted with the EDTA. (one for each of the
terminal carboxylic acid groups)

\hypertarget{six.}{%
\subsection{Six.}\label{six.}}

Yes. Sulphuric acid has the same activity of any normal acid catalyst,
providing a ready source and sink for \(H^{+}\) ions, facilitating the
internal structural changes necessary for ester formation.

Pentyl ethanol is used:

\item

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{eight}{%
\subsection{Eight}\label{eight}}

Zeolite is micro-porous, that is within its 3D chemical structure there
is a regular arrangement of regular sized gaps/holes/pores,through which
other molecules, if sufficiently small could pass through. molecules
which are too large however, (such as molecules with a diameter greater
than X in the figure below) can. Such molecules suffer size exclusion,
as although they may have the correct chemical properties to react with
binding sites on the interior, they are physically prevented from
reaching these sites, as the are too large, and so cannot bind.

\hypertarget{aim}{%
\section{Aim}\label{aim}}

Two different experiments where performed with different aims.

The aim of experiment A was to determine the Ability of Zeolite to bind
Calcium ions from solution. Both to determine how effective Zeolite
could be as a cleaning/filtering agent to remove calcium impurities, and
to approximate how much zeolite (by mass) would be necessary to remove
calcium from a contaminated solution.

The aim of experiment B was to determine Zeolite ability to act as a
Acid catalyst (in esterification.)

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Zeolites Are complex three dimensional molecules formed from the
condensation of \$Si(OH)\emph{\{4\} \$} and \(Ai(OH)^{-}_{4}\) monomers.
The striking feature of the complexes formed are the regularly sized and
evenly space pores which the macro structure contains, (See the figure
below). This regular arrangement has many potentially important chemical
applications. One such application is the ability of Zeolites to act as
molecular sponges/ filters soaking up particles of the correct size to
fit through the microspores which binding to the interior of the
molecule.furthermore Zeolites can also act as effective inorganic acid
catalyst, there complex macro structure providing many catalytically
active sites. Such catalyst have the added advantage that, as the
catalyst is solid state, removal and reuse if far simpler and less
energetically expensive than a conventional acid catalyst such as
sulphuric acid.
