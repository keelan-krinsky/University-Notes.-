If four and a half billion years of evolution, twelve thousand years of agriculture and a hundred years of nutritional science (Mozaffarian et al, 2018) has taught us anything, it is that the importance of food simply cannot be underestimated. Indeed, the dramatic increase in human life span to double that of ancestral humans, was largely due to improved access to nutrition and medicine (Finch and Caleb,2010). Furthermore, there is now significant evidence to suggest that many major diseases such as cardiovascular disease (Mente et al, 2009), or cancer (Bringham nad Sheila et al, 2004) are better combatted by prevention with effective diet than dirrect medical treating which can be very expensive, and imply unpleasant side effects. The role of diet, in basic nutrition and disease prevention is especially evident in old age, with the increased incidence of degenerative diseases such as Altzhiemers (Arendt and Bigl, 1987). However, dispite the well established importance of diet, what would constitute the ideal diet, is still not entirely clear, although many sugesstions have been made. The MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet, is one such suggestion. It combines aspects of the classic medeteranian diet,consisting predominately of fish, fruit and vegitables, with the newer DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which includes increased dairy consuption and decreased sodium intake, to prevent nerodegenerative disease. This dietary plan has not gone without critisicm,however, its overall efficacy is well supported by field trials, and it severes as a much needed guidline in the complex and confusing arena of dietary science.

To truely appreciate the advantages offered by the MIND diet requires a more detailed view of its constituets and their metabolic effects. The mind diet is based around splitting common food sources into two generl groups, brian healthy and brain unhealthy, encouraging increased consumption of the former, and decresed consupmtion of the latter. (Di Fiore N., 2015)  Brain healthy foods include vegitables (especially green leafy) vegitables, whole grains, berries, nuts, beans, wine (in limited quantities), fish, poultry, and olive oil, whereas brain unhealthy foods include cheese,red meats,fried foods, butter/margerine, or pasteries and sweets (Marcason and Wendy,2015). All of these food groups, both healthy and unhealthy are broken down by specific anabolic pathways into their basic substituents, which can then be catabolised into new macromolecules, whith the production of side/waste products along the way.(Garrett and Grisham, 4th edition). Hence, which food groups are consumed will affect the extend and amount of raw mataerials avaiable for anabolism, and the expore to toxic metabolic by products.    

The metabolism of leafy green vegetables provides a ponient example of the importance of consuming the appropraite substrates for metabolism, and the potential advantages offered by the MIND diet. Leafy greens contain significant component of proteins and carbohydrates 
(Menasah et al, 2018), with very low unsaturated or trans fat components. 
(Singh et al, 2001). The starch component of the carbohydrates present can be hydrolysed to glocuse molecules, which provide an important energy source to brain cells, which can not use any other substrate as an energy source, while many of the proteins may contain metal ion prosthetic groups, which form a vital source of micronutrients, for the cell. In particular the $Mg^{2+}$ ions present in the chorophyll of such leaves is a vital cofactor for many of the enzymes involved in glucogenesis, (the break down of glucoses to release energy), hence without a steady supply of $Mg^{2+}$ ions the brain cells would again be starved of an energy source, among many other deleterious consequences. Finally the low 
trans and unsaturated fat concentration in leafy green helps specifically to reduce the changes of neuroegenrative disease with highly unsaturated trans fats (such as in red meat or pasteries), associated with the incindence of Altzheimers. (Morris et al, 2003). Similar metabolic themes can be indetified for the other compents of the MIND diet, to provide a thorough explintion for its contribution to decreased risk of neurodegenerative disease. 

The effecacy of the diet plan does not rest solely on theory however, as there is  also a wealth of empirical evidence linking its application to decreased incidicnet of nerodegenerative disease. Stronger adherance to the diet has been strongly correlated to lower rates of decline in working memory, episodic memory, visiospacial ability, and perceptual speed, as general cognition scores, with strict adherence effectively delaying the deterioraation process by as much as 7.5 years (Morris et al, 2015). Perhaps even more importantly even intermedite levels of compliance with the diet show a dramatic (35\%) reduction in the incidence of altzhiemer disease. (Moris et al 2015).   
However, despite the theoretical and empircal support for the diets efficacy, it is not without limitations.  Chief among these limitations is that the MIND diet (and indeed any general diet), is that despite the general correlation discuessed the effect of the diet on any given individual is variable, dedpendant upon both the genetics, and behavioural patterns. (Schelke et al, 2018)

In conclusion, the MIND diet combines both the time tested Meditarnian diet, and its more recent dirrivative the DASH diet, to form a diet specifically taylored to prevention, and mediation of neurodegenerative disease. The diet groups common food types generally into brain healthy and brain unhealthy foods, based on the biological consequences of the metabolites which they generate, both in terms of the nutritional value of end products of metabolism as well as the potentil deliterious effects of the waste/side products. The theory behind this classification relies on considerations of well established and experimentally verified metabolic pathways, and impirical trials show strong links between the diet and decreased neurodegenerative disease. While the effectiveness of the diet may vary to a degree between individauls due to genetically or behaviourally based idiocincracies in metabolism. However, in general it provides an easily understandable and useful guidline for neurodegenerative disease prevention, even at relatively low levels of diet compliance. High levels of diet compliance combined with bespoke modifications to the basic diet plan can lead to truely extraordinary improvments in neurodegerative disease prevention.

Since 1800, lifespans have doubled again, largely due to improvements in environment, food, and medicine that minimized mortality at earlier ages. Infections cause most mortality in wild chimpanzees and in traditional forager-farmers with limited access to modern medicine. Although we know little of the diseases of aging under premodern conditions, in captivity, chimpanzees present a lower incidence of cancer, ischemic heart disease, and neurodegeneration than current human populations. These major differences in pathology of aging are discussed in terms of genes that mediate infection, inflammation, and nutrition.
