# problem#1
## genotypes
LL, Ll, ll.
## phenotypes
long haired, short haired.
# problem#2
type of genetic inheritance is co-dominance
## first cross
### parents
RR X RR
### offspring
RR
## second cross
###parents
WW X WW
### offspring
WW
## third Cross
### parents
RR X WW
### off spring
RW
## fourth cross
### parents
RW X RW
### offspring.
RR, RW, WW
# Problem#3
If male parent's mother was O then Male parent must have at least one
i allele.
If male parent is blood type IB then male parent must have at least one B allele.
hence male parent must be IBi.
If female parent is blood type A, she can not have inherited any IB from her
father. also as her father is blood type B she could not have inherited any IA
from her father either (as he doesn't have any).
hence she must have inherited allele i from her father, but as she is blood
type A she must have genotype IAi
## blood types of offspring
AB (25%), B(25%) A(25%) O(25%)
