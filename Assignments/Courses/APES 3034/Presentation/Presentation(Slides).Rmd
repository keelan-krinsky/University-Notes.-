# Presentation

## Slide 1

 #. Globally, $>1 000 000$ spp rely on tropical freshwater ecosystems for survival.

## Slide 2
 #. Pollution and global warming have led to large scale degradation of aquatic systems and deterioriation of water quality. 
 #. Deteriating water quality impact serious of the biology of aquatic systems. 
    #. A third to a half of fish and amphibian spp in some areas are already extinct or endangered.

## Slide 4 
 #. Effect on Freshwater invertebrates (specifically crabs) been affected? 
 #. Why is it so important to know? 
    #. What are freshwater crabs? 
    #. Where are they found? 
    #. what ecological roles do they fill

## Slide 5
### What are Freeshwater crabs?
 #. Crabs of decapods of the infraorder Branchyra, (the largest of all decapod groups)
 #.  $\frac{1}{5}$ of all crabs are freshwater crabs including the superfamilies:
     #. Gecarinucodiea, Potamoidea, Psuedothelphusodiea, and Trichodactyloidea.

## Slide 6 
### Where are They found? 
 #. Rivers, Streams waterfalls, karsts, and caves.
 #. Almost all clean water bodies from moist lowland forests to rugged mountains
 #. Many are also semi-terrestrial. 
 #. Require prestine water conditions to survive

## Slide 7 
### Ecological Role of Freshwater crabs. 
#### Feeding
 #. Predators
    #. control populations of aquatic insects and gastropods. 
 #. Herbivors.
    #. fallen leaves, algae and beachnuts. 
 #. Detritovors
    #. Dead frogs and snakes.

## Slide 8   
### Nutrient Cycling  
  #. Ditrotivor feeding habits
Shredding guild
  #. 88-94\% of overall biomass in the streams and debris dams in the eastern Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. 
  #. Very important to dynamics of nutrient cycling. 
  #. food for a wide range of predators,
      #. Otters, mongooses, civets, kites, ergets, herons, and kingfishers, eels bullfrogs, toads, monitor lizards and crocodiles. 
        #. Pseudothelphusids preyed upon by turtles and capuchin monkeys, and in Asia fresh preyed upon by wild boar. and stream snakes. (_Opisthrotropis kikuzatoi_)
        #. Case study
          #. Invasive north american crayfish, out competed replaced native crabs, decrease in clawless otter populations. 
          #. Fragmented freshwater habitats 
 #. Low fercundity, direct development and low vagility, frequent isolation and allopatric speciation, high levels of endemism. 
 #. Niche specialisation sympatric speciation leadinging to increased diversity. One site five species occupying different habitats. 
 #. Studies in malasia suggest that freshwater crabs may face the same fate. 
 #. 2008 IUCN Red list threatened species (within all five major families), increase from 93 is Asia and Africa to 1280 globally. 

Wide spread destruction of tropical environments etc.           




#. What was done? 
    #. 1280 freshwater crabs from the troppical regions of Americas Africa, Asia and Australasia. 
        #. Families, Pseudothelphusidae, Trichodactylidae, Potamonautidae, Potamidae and Gecarcinucidae. 

 #. medical importance as paragonimiasis hosts in Asiea Africa and Neotropics, (food borne zoonosis)
    #. 20 million people infected world wide. 
    #. Biting blackfly. _Simulium spp_, 
      #. Vector of infection for parasite _Onchocerca volvultus_, river blindness (onchocerciassis in Africa.). 
      

  #. basis of small scale fisheries (Lakes malawi and Tanganyika in East africa).
