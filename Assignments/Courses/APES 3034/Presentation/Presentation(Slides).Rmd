# Presentation

## Slide 1

 #. Globally, $>1 000 000$ spp rely on tropical freshwater ecosystems for survival.

## Slide 2
### The threat
 #.  Large scale degradation of aquatic systems and deterioriation of water quality due to: 
    #. Pollution, global warming, and Deforestation.
 #. Deteriating water quality impact serious of the biology of aquatic systems. 
    #. A third to a half of fish and amphibian spp in some areas are already extinct or endangered.

## Slide 4 
 #. Effect on Freshwater invertebrates (specifically crabs) been affected? 
 #. Why is it so important to know? 
    #. What are freshwater crabs? 
    #. Where are they found? 
    #. what ecological roles do they fill?
    #. What economic impact do they have?

## Slide 5
### What are Freeshwater crabs?
 #. Crabs of decapods of the infraorder Branchyra, (the largest of all decapod groups)
 #.  $\frac{1}{5}$ of all crabs are freshwater crabs including the superfamilies:
     #. Gecarinucodiea, Potamoidea, Psuedothelphusodiea, and Trichodactyloidea.

## Slide 6 
### Where are They found? 
 #. Rivers, Streams waterfalls, karsts, and caves.
 #. Almost all clean water bodies from moist lowland forests to rugged mountains
 #. Many are also semi-terrestrial. 
 #. Require prestine water conditions to survive

## Slide 7 
### Ecological Role of Freshwater crabs. 
#### Feeding
 #. Predators
    #. control populations of aquatic insects and gastropods. 
 #. Herbivors.
    #. fallen leaves, algae and beachnuts. 
 #. Detritovors
    #. Dead frogs and snakes.

## Slide 8   
### Nutrient Cycling  
  #. Ditrotivor feeding habits (Shredding guild)
  #. 88-94\% of overall biomass in the streams and debris dams in the eastern Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. 
  #. Very important to dynamics of nutrient cycling. 

## Slide 9
### Prey species
  #. Food for a wide range of predators. 
      #. Otters, mongooses, civets, kites, ergets, herons, and kingfishers, eels bullfrogs, toads, monitor lizards and crocodiles, turtles, capuchin monkeys, wild boar. and stream snakes.

## Slide 10
### Prey species 
 #. Invasive north american crayfish, replaced native crabs in western Kenya
 #. Upward trophic casdace, decrease in clawless otter populations.

## Slide 11
### Crabs as a source of genetic diversity. 
 #. Alleopathic speciation
    #. Low fercundity 
    #. Low vagility
    #. Fragmented nature of aquatic water bodies
 #. Sympatric speciation
    #. Niche specialisation
    #. Up to 5 different species in one site

## Slide 12 
### Economic importance of fresh water crabs

#### Crabs as a food Source. 
 #. The dirrect consumption of Crabs as a food source is wide spread
 #. Crab fisheries in Lakes Malawe and Tanganyika fuel the local economy.

## Slide 13
## Medicinal importance
 #. Crabs act as a host species for several important human parasites
     #. Paragonimiasis: (a food borne zoonosis)
        #.diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, cough, pulmonary abnormalities
        #. 20 million people infected world wide.
     #. Biting blackfly. _Simulium spp_,
        #. Vector of infection for parasite _Onchocerca volvultus_, which causes onchocerciassis (river blindness).

## Slide 14 
### Anthropic effects on Freshwater Crabs. 
 #. Lack of research detailing current ecological status
 #. Existing research suggests many freshwater crab species seriously endanger
 #.  2008 IUCN Red list incread number of threatened of endanger species from 93 to 1280 globally.

### Slide 15
### Purpose of the research
  #. Assess anthropic effects and ecological status of fresh water crabs. 
  #. Comprehensive study including
      #. 1280 freshwater crabs
      #. Tropical regions of Americas, Africa, Asia and Australasia. 
      #. All five major families (as above)
