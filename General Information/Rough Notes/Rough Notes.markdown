### acids and bases.

#### pH
$pH=-log_{10}[H^(+)]$

####ka

$k_{a}=\frac{[A^{-}][H^+]}{[HA]}$

#### pKa
$pka=\log_{10}(pk_a)$

#### dependant and independent variables.

#### Buffers
NOTE: buffers may be temperature sensitive, for example Tris buffers. phosphate buffers are more reliable but it is still best to take temperature into consideration

#### Indicator dyes.

##### examples
1. phenlythyelian (spelling)
2. bromothymyl blue (spelling)
3. methyl orange

##### paper strips
inaccurate but useful for rough estimations of pH or to identify changes in pH

##### Electrode
accurate to two decimal places.

## Survivor ship curves

insert appropriate graphs.

### Type1 1

#### Typical populations
domestic pets and humans in the developed world

### Type 2

#### Typical populations
1. seeds in a seed bank
2. marmites.

### Type 3

#### typical populations
large mammals.

### Reproductive Rate  
combination of many factors.
1. length of reproductive season.
2. (reproduced output ) number of offspring produced.
3. Investment
4. generation length (time between birth of mother and birth of daughter)
5. age of maturity.

#### potential population rate of change.
how fast populations can change. $r_{m} ~or~ r$ are common symbols for the maximum growth rate.

### K selecting
adaptions which favour ability to survive over the ability to reproduce. well adapted to predictable, crowded environments with significant resource scarcity.

#### general traits
1. large
2. can deffer reproduction to a later time.
3. iteroparous.
4. high investment per offspring
5. body resources invested more into survival than reproduction.

### R selecting
unpredictable environments, periods/ areas of sudden abundance.

#### general traits
1. small(er)
2. earlier maturity
3. invest in reproduction versus survival
4. many offspring but with low investment per offspring.

#### Variation in abundance over time.
1. patchy resource allocation
2. inter-species interactions (predation, symbiosis)
3. environment
4. social structure

##### resources.
physicochemical.
conditions.  
1. temperature
2. humidity
3. occupancy.

## defining environments.
environments are a smooth continuum of suitable (good) to unsuitable (bad). There is a threshold below which conditions are too ad to sustain a particular organism, below this line there are no available habitats. above this  line there is spectrum of habitats varying from poor to good, with associated increase in survival and reproductive rates.
##### Examples
Elephants in the Kruger

 because of artificial water easy for herds with young elephants to move around which otherwise they would be unable to migrate.
artificial water sources. this artificially increased the carrying capacity.

## Population Ecology

### Plant herbivore systems
1. getting nutrition from plants sucks. (very difficult)

#### Strategies
1. Be clever ()behavioural adaptations

how to find the nest food from a poor pool of available food sources.

eat a lot when plants are gree (during and just after the rainy season.

##### late wet season
1. focus on preferred foods (selective deeding (narrow niche breadth
  grow body size, build up fat reserves
  ##### early dry season
  2. less preferred foods
  3. maintain body mass/ far reserves

  ##### late dry season
  1. avoided/unpalatable foods (evergreens )
2. nutritional stress ()nonselective/less selective, wide niche breadth.

##### forage categories
1. quality
2. staple
    relatively large amounts are available.
    food is relatively nutritious and palatable
3. restricted intake
    there is normally a severe shortage of these foods but the animal has a high preference for them (they are often highly nutritious)
4. reserve
    It is possible to live/sustain for long periods on reserve foods.

5.  buffer
only eaten wheen there is no other food available.


animals prefer quality or staple foods which contain more nutrients to reserves of buffer foods. however they only consume high quantities of these food in the wet and early dry season under normal circumstances, as there are not freely accesible throughout the year,

#### morphological adaptations

what to do with cell walls. symbiosis between animas and microbes (even in in termites)

##### Rumen (ruminants )

###### Examples
cows, and buffalo

Rumen is a four chambered stomach

insert image.

###### process
1. silica and food is rolled into a bolus in the back of the mouth and swallowed dow the oesophagus
2. at the end of the oesophagus the reticulum sorts fibre into the rumen and nutritious food directly into the omasum.

NOTE: some microbes are also digested so the stomach is in effect acting as some form of microbe farm.

###### Cenalid digestion (cecum )
horse, zebra, elephants, lagomorphs (eg rabbits etc)
insert image.

NOTE: the ceacum and the rumen both make use of fermentation.

#### Ruminants
better use of higher quality foods
cannot digest poor quality foods well
digestion of fibre is too slow to support the animal.
have the advantage in the wet season.

#### Caecalids
wide tolerance for plant quality
cannot gain as much nutrition from high quality foods
advantage in the dry season (niche differentiation)

### Plants perspective

#### Defence mechanisms / grazing resistance.
All strategies  which deal with herbivore disturbance.

##### Tolerance
increased growth

##### avoidance
reduced grazing.

###### morphological characteristics
spines, thorn prickles, shell for seeds or nuts
cellulose lignin incorporated into the plant structure

###### Biochemical
tannins/ toxins.

Qualitative
Toxins capable of causing severe physiological distress in the the animals whin ingest the. foe example HCN
these compounds are very expensive to produce and so normally only small plants which do not grow fast (so need to conserve all of their accumulated biomass tend to produce these toxins. these toxins as a generally rule are either present in sufficiently high concentrations to provide severe discouragement to potential herbivores, or they are entirely absent.

Quantitative

tannins, detergents
quantity varies all tannins are compounds which bind to proteins making them harder to digest.

Defence
a defence is effective if it is a feature of an organism which increases the energy spent by a consumer in locating and handling that organism (as a result the consumer will eat less of it.)

### Herbivor- carnivor relationships
#### prey
nutritional quality
plants 40C:1N
Animals 10C: N
animals can run away

##### searching preditoes Coursing,
Test out a herd to identify the most favourable prey items

##### Sit and wait predator (Ambush)
have a particular kill zone, any potential prey item entering this kill zine is at risk of being attacked/consumed.   
###### Examples
most cats, carnivorous plants, spiders.

Generalist strategy/ polyphagous

eat lots of different things
may have a preference for a particular prey type
kill and eat quickly, (short handling time
  search time is relatively long
  cannot easily begin new search while still handling the current prey item
  intake is maximize by eating whatever is found (within broad limits)

  examples
  black back jackals
  insectivorous birds

  Specialists (Monophagous )
  handling is long compared to food search times
  intake is maximized by specializing on a particle prey type
  focus on food types that can be attained most efficiently
  live within site of prey, but because attack and handling is energy expensive and may be dangerous, they focus on the most profitable prey items (sick , injured, naive.

##### Role of the environment

  broad diets are favoured in pow productivity environments while specialist diets are favoured in highly productive environments.

  ##### impact on prey populations
  additive effect (decease in population density/abundance)
  predation adds to other sources of mortality

  Compensatory effect
  different sources of mortality trade off/ compensate each other for example an animal will either die from disease, starvation or predation either way the animal is bound to die.

  ### Host parasite

  #### macro parasite
  tapeworm

#### microparasite
1. virus bacteria, protist

#### transmission
often transmission is an passive process on the part of the parasite
disease dynamics and outbreaks
basics reproductive rate/ number.
 the average number of newly infected hosts which would arise from a single infected host in a population od susceptible hosts $R_0$.

$R_0>1 \rightarrow$ the infectious disease spreads.
$R_0 <1 \rightarrow$ infectious disease recedes.
$R_{0}=1$ = transmission threshold. (must be crossed for a disease to spread,)

##### Factors affecting $R_{0}$
1. S- the number of susceptible hosts.
2. L the time period over which a host is infectious
3. $Beta$ the transmission rate or probability

###### threshold population size
 population size above which a disease is likely to spread through the population  
$S_{T}=\frac{1}{\Beta L}$

## Valence Bond Theory

### History
Valence bond theory was the First quantum mechanical theory
developed. It was developed by Walter Heitler, friz London and Linus Pauling, and helped to explain concepts which were poorly predicted by VSPER theory such as diamagnetic/ paramagnetic properties.

### Basics

#### Wave functions.
the wave function of an electron pair is formed by superimposing the wave function for the separate fragments of a molecule.

##### Electrons
Each electron will have a wave function $\psi$  that describes the behaviour of that electron.
(section 1.2 in book)

the probability of finding an electron at any given location is given by $\chi= \psi^{2}$

$/chi$ is used to represent the orbital of a given electron.

##### bonds
each bond will also have a wave function which describes the movement of electrons within that orbital.

###### examples

the bond between two hydrogen can be expressed as
$\psi= \chi_{A}(1)\chi_{B}(2)$
( or $\psi=\chi_{A}(2)\chi_{B}(1)$ is just as valid )
