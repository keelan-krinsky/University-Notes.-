### acids and bases.

#### pH
$pH=-log_{10}[H^(+)]$

####ka

$k_{a}=\frac{[A^{-}][H^+]}{[HA]}$

#### pKa
$pka=\log_{10}(pk_a)$

#### dependant and independent variables.

#### Buffers
NOTE: buffers may be temperature sensitive, for example Tris buffers. phosphate buffers are more reliable but it is still best to take temperature into consideration

#### Indicator dyes.

##### examples
1. phenlythyelian (spelling)
2. bromothymyl blue (spelling)
3. methyl orange

##### paper strips
inaccurate but useful for rough estimations of pH or to identify changes in pH

##### Electrode
accurate to two decimal places.

## Valence Bond Theory

### History
Valence bond theory was the First quantum mechanical theory
developed. It was developed by Walter Heitler, friz London and Linus Pauling, and helped to explain concepts which were poorly predicted by VSPER theory such as diamagnetic/ paramagnetic properties.

### Basics

#### Wave functions.
the wave function of an electron pair is formed by superimposing the wave function for the separate fragments of a molecule.

##### Electrons
Each electron will have a wave function $\psi$  that describes the behaviour of that electron.
(section 1.2 in book)

the probability of finding an electron at any given location is given by $\chi= \psi^{2}$

$/chi$ is used to represent the orbital of a given electron.

##### bonds
each bond will also have a wave function which describes the movement of electrons within that orbital.

###### examples

the bond between two hydrogen can be expressed as
$\psi= \chi_{A}(1)\chi_{B}(2)$
( or $\psi=\chi_{A}(2)\chi_{B}(1)$ is just as valid )
