### acids and bases.

#### pH
$pH=-log_{10}[H^(+)]$

####ka

$k_{a}=\frac{[A^{-}][H^+]}{[HA]}$

#### pKa
$pka=\log_{10}(pk_a)$

#### dependant and independant variables.

#### Buffers
NOTE: buffers may be temperature sensitive, for example Tris buffers. phosphate buffers are more reliable but it is still best to take temperature into consideration

#### Indicator dyes.

##### examples
1. phenlythyelian (spelling)
2. bromothymyl blue (spelling)
3. methyl orange

##### paper strips
inaccurate but useful for rough estimations of pH or to identify changes in pH

##### Electrode
accurate to two decimal places.

## Survivor ship curves

insert appropriate graphs.

### Type1 1

#### Typical populations
domestic pets and humans in the developed world

### Type 2

#### Typical populations
1. seeds in a seed bank
2. marmites.

### Type 3

#### typical populations
large mammals.

### Reproductive Rate  
combination of many factors.
1. length of reproductive season.
2. (reproduced output ) number of offspring produced.
3. Investment
4. generation length (time between birth of mother and birth of daughter)
5. age of maturity.

#### potential population rate of change.
how fast populations can change. $r_{m} ~or~ r$ are common symbols for the maximum growth rate.

### K selecting
adaptions which favour ability to survive over the ability to reproduce. well adapted to predictable, crowded environments with significant resource scarcity.

#### general traits
1. large
2. can deffer reproduction to a later time.
3. iteroparous.
4. high investment per offspring
5. body resources invested more into survival than reproduction.

### R selecting
unpredictable environments, periods/ areas of sudden abundance.

#### general traits
1. small(er)
2. earlier maturity
3. invest in reproduction versus survival
4. many offspring but with low investment per offspring.

#### Variation in abundance over time.
1. patchy resource allocation
2. inter-species interactions (predation, symbiosis)
3. environment
4. social structure

##### resources.
physicochemical.
conditions.  
1. temperature
2. humidity
3. occupancy.

## defining environments.
environments are a smooth continuum of suitable (good) to unsuitable (bad). There is a threshold below which conditions are too ad to sustain a particular organism, below this line there are no available habitats. above this  line there is spectrum of habitats varying from poor to good, with associated increase in survival and reproductive rates.
##### Examples
Elephants in the Kruger

 because of artificial water easy for herds with young elephants to move around which otherwise they would be unable to migrate.
artificial water sources. this artificially increased the carrying capacity.

## Valence Bond Theory

### History
Valence bond theory was the First quantum mechanical theory
developed. It was developed by Walter Heitler, friz London and Linus Pauling, and helped to explain concepts which were poorly predicted by VSPER theory such as diamagnetic/ paramagnetic properties.

### Basics

#### Wave functions.
the wave function of an electron pair is formed by superimposing the wave function for the separate fragments of a molecule.

##### Electrons
Each electron will have a wave function $\psi$  that describes the behaviour of that electron.
(section 1.2 in book)

the probability of finding an electron at any given location is given by $\chi= \psi^{2}$

$/chi$ is used to represent the orbital of a given electron.

##### bonds
each bond will also have a wave function which describes the movement of electrons within that orbital.

###### examples

the bond between two hydrogen can be expressed as
$\psi= \chi_{A}(1)\chi_{B}(2)$
( or $\psi=\chi_{A}(2)\chi_{B}(1)$ is just as valid )
