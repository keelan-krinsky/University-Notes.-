would naturally occur after weening however as cow milk is a staple part
of most human diabetes the genes controlling lactase production are
never switched off and the ability to digest lactose is not normally
lost.

\hypertarget{genetic-complementation}{%

two different mutations in heterozygous condition affecting the same

\hypertarget{examples-1}{%

rare form of albinism: both mother and father were normally pigmented
and there families had minimal instances of albinism. however both
children where albino' s . Analysis found that this albinism stemmed not
from those genes and mutation most commonly associated with albinism but
rather from a combination of recessives (heterozygous) from both father
and mother (mutations in TYRP1 gene), which on their own would have
little or no effect on the pigment production pathway, but when combined
reduced pigment production significantly.

NOTE: Rufus albinism leads to a phenotype with reddish hair, lighter
skin, and blue grey eyes.

the centromere is very far to the one side of the chromosome, with a
long arm containing most of the genes and a short arm containing
predominantly temolmeric DNA.

humans do not posses any telocentric chromosomes, but certain insect of

\hypertarget{holocentric}{%

Centromere like structure exist along the entire length of the
chromosome. this may decrease the chances of faulty division/
segregation.

\hypertarget{chromosome-banding}{%

bands were named and used to locate specific genes. the banding patterns
are due to uneven DNA densities in the coiled structure of the

\hypertarget{trisomy}{%
\paragraph{Trisomy}\label{trisomy}}

when an individual inherits three copies of a particular chromosome. In
Humans only three of all the possible trisomies are viable, (as in
individuals with these mutations will still br born and not terminated
during pregnancy)

of these three (Trisomy 13, 18, and 21) only individuals with trisomy 21
can survive past the first few years of childhood. Individuals with
Trisomy 21 have down syndrome.

NOTE: the smaller relative size of chromosome 21, meaning that it
contains less important genes may be related to its increased viability
.

\hypertarget{monosomy}{%
\paragraph{Monosomy}\label{monosomy}}

when an individual inherits only one copy of a particular chromosome.

\hypertarget{nullisomy}{%
\paragraph{Nullisomy}\label{nullisomy}}

\hypertarget{non-disjuncture}{%
\paragraph{non disjuncture}\label{non-disjuncture}}

(review mitosis and meiosis) If non disjuncture happens in meiosis it is
generally worse than if it happens in mitosis as it will affect the
whole organism.

\hypertarget{down-syndrome}{%
\subparagraph{Down Syndrome}\label{down-syndrome}}

occurs in about 1 of a thousand live births. originates from non
disjunction in the egg cell rather than the sperm cell because the
arrested development of the egg cells leads to decay of the separating
and marking proteins as well as the spindle fibre leaving the whole
process open to more error. 8\% of individuals survive for one year ?

\hypertarget{turner-syndrome}{%

levels and as the more X's the higher the chance of brain damage.

\hypertarget{xyy}{%
\subparagraph{XYY}\label{xyy}}

XYY has the phenotype of a normal make. men with 2 Y chromosomes tend to
be tall as there is a cumulative effect adding to height. (they may also
exhibit increased aggression but this in unclear)

\hypertarget{polyploidy}{%
\paragraph{Polyploidy}\label{polyploidy}}

most often flowering plants are polyploid, they are even specifically
breed to have more chromosome sets as this usually increases fruit and
flower size.

\hypertarget{examples-2}{%
\subparagraph{Examples}\label{examples-2}}

water melon must be bread from a tetraploid(?) and a diploid to get a
tripliod infertile plant.

Kiwi fruit 12-16 copies

Strawberries 4 copies (tetraploid)

NOTE: plants are better adapted to polyploid because: 1. they are not as
confined to a set physical form so different in growth and development
genes operation levels are not so important 2. they can reproduce
vegetatively so polyploid individuals aren't as severely evolutionarily
disadvantaged.

\hypertarget{deletions}{%

\hypertarget{piece-of-chrome}{%

sometimes multiple genes are lost when both strands break and a part of
the chromosome is permanently lost. A specific deletion on chromosome 5.
(where the entire p arm is deleted leads to a serious syndrome)

environments are a smooth continuum of suitable (good) to unsuitable

a particular organism, below this line there are no available habitats.
above this line there is spectrum of habitats varying from poor to good,
with associated increase in survival and reproductive rates. \#\#\#\#\#

around which otherwise they would be unable to migrate. artificial water
