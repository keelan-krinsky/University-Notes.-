### Phenylketonuria
single mutation
can affect brain development however if the correct diet is followed then all detrimental health consequences can be ignored.

### diabetes type II
lifestyle disease, the genetic component is estimated to change the likelihood of developing the disease by 2%, but the main causative factors of the disease relate to diet.

### Lactose intolerance.
Individuals with lactose intolerance cant digest lactose, however the bacteria in their gut van which leads to the build up of gas. this can be very painful for the person in question.In humans lactose intolerance would naturally occur after weening however as cow milk is a staple part of most human diabetes the genes controlling lactase production are never switched off and the ability to digest lactose is not normally lost.

### Himalayan Phenotype.

### Cancer
In most cases cancer is not inherited. In  breast cancer/ovarian cancer BS1, BS2 play some role in genetic disposition, perhaps 5-10%

Cancer normally sets in during old age as cells must accumulate a series of a specific set of notations, (exactly which set of mutations accumulated lead to cancer is highly individual)

#### Environmental factors
1. UV
2. X rays
3. Alcohol
4. Overcooked food (amines, heterocyclic, aromatic hydrocarbons-meat. acrylamide- potatoes
5. Azo dyes
6. tartrazine (food colourants)
7. Nitrate cured foods
8. Pesticides

#### Cancer initiators
agents which cause DNA damage (mutagens). these factors may be chemical, biological (such as HPV- human papilloma virus cause latent genetic damage- Cancer predisposition.

#### Cancer Promoters

Promotes excessive proliferation (does not directly damage DNA).

##### Examples
1. wounding
2. phorbol esters
3. HRT/ oestrogen (breast cancer)
4. hepatitis B (promotes stomach cancer)
5. HIV (Kaposi sarcoma, this disease is always present but only manifests itself in immunocompromised individuals)

#### Penetrance
 percentage of the population who demonstrate at least some degree fo phenotypic expression.

#### Expressivity
reflects the range of expressions of the gene/allele present in the population.  

#### Genetic complementation
two different mutations in heterozygous condition affecting the same protein/ pathway can compliment each other to cause a novel phenotypic effect.

##### examples
rare form of albinism: both mother and father were normally pigmented and there families had minimal instances of albinism. however both children where albino' s . Analysis found that this albinism stemmed not from those genes and mutation most commonly associated with albinism but rather from a combination of recessives (heterozygous) from both father and mother (mutations in TYRP1 gene), which on their own would have little or no effect on the pigment production pathway, but when combined reduced pigment production significantly.

NOTE: Rufus albinism leads to a phenotype with reddish hair, lighter skin, and blue grey eyes.

#### Forked line probability method.

##chromosome level
(revise mitosis and meosis)
copy slides
chromosome basic structure
#### chromosome groups

##### meta-centric
centromere is half way up the length of the chromosome

##### submetacentric
centromere is more to the one side of the chromosome than the other,

##### Acrocentric
the centromere is very far to the one side of the chromosome, with a long arm containing most of the genes and a short arm containing predominantly temolmeric DNA.

##### Telocentric  
humans do not posses any telocentric chromosomes, but certain insect of crustation species do.

##### Holocentric
